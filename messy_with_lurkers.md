#### Solution:

People have to join in order to try, and when joining is low-cost, and
completion low-benefit, it is not surprising that many people will
“dissipate” as the course progresses. The “messiness” of co-learning is
interesting because it points to a sort of “internal dissipation”, as
contributors bring their multiple different backgrounds, interests, and
communication styles to bear.

#### Challenges:

If we were to describe this situation in the traditional subject/object,
sender/receiver terms of information theory, we would say that peer
production has a “low signal to noise ratio”, and we would tend to think
of it as a highly inefficient process. However, it may be more
appropriate (and constructive) to think of meanings as co-constructed as
the process runs, and of messiness (or meaninglessness) as symptomatic,
not of peer production itself, but of deficiencies or infelicities in
shared meaning-making and “integrating” features.

#### What’s Next:

What comes out of thinking about the anti-pattern is that we need to be
careful about how we think about “virtues” in a peer production setting.
It is not just a question of being a “good contributor” to an existing
project, but of continually improving the methods that this project uses
to make meaning.
