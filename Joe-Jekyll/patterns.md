Introduction {#sec:Introduction}
============

Readers will have encountered peer production, at least in applications
like Wikipedia, StackExchange, and free/libre/open source software
development. In this paper we apply design patterns to understand the
human side of this kind of socio-technical development. In the Peeragogy
project, we aim to build upon these inspiring examples to help design
the future of education.

We have found design patterns tremendously useful for organizing our
thinking about these matters. However, there is a key difference between
our pattern catalog and previous collections of design patterns that
touch on similar domains – like *Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language
for Communication Revolution* [1] and *Pedagogical
Patterns: Advice for Educators* [2]. Our pattern
catalog is our primary project management tool, and as such, it evolves
in close symbiosis with the Peeragogy project. There are clear
precedents for this way of working within the design pattern tradition,
reaching back into its prehistory [3]. A quite
convincing implementation of Christopher Alexander’s idea of patterns as
a “living language” [4] [p. xvii] was realized with
one of the earliest applications of wiki software developed by Ward
Cunningham: the Portland Pattern Repository. What we’ve developed is a
further iteration of this idea. To use a visual metaphor, whereas other
pattern languages are mostly top-down, ours is bottom-up. That is,
structure is explicitly emergent. As we will detail below, these
features are built into our pattern template and the way we use the
pattern catalog. This style of project management is suitable for a
project that itself has emergent structure. The result is a hands-on
counterpart to existing sociological and historical research on peer
production, surveyed in [5].

Many of the patterns described in this paper were first shared in a
private Drupal forum, and were first made public on a Wordpress blog as
part of our *Peeragogy Handbook*.  They were then
discussed via gMail, Google+, and Google Hangouts, “hive edited” in real
time on Google Docs, format-shifted with pandoc, typeset with XeLaTeX,
hive edited again with ShareLaTeX, and then moved into Github and
bridged to Authorea for final edits. Along the way, some of the patterns
made an appearance at a PhD thesis defense [6], and the
pattern template was revised and revised again. Schematically, this is
what the current template tells us:

We believe that our pattern catalog will be useful for students and
educators who want their work to have real-world relevance, to activists
and policy-makers who want to develop practicable solutions to
large-scale problems, and to employees and managers who, like it or not,
find themselves working in distributed teams. Our approach to emergent
organization will also be of interest to theorists of social interaction
in fields like organization studies and, increasingly, computer science.
The next section introduces the in the form of a design pattern.
Sections [sec:Roadmap]–[sec:Scrapbook] list the main patterns in our
catalog. Figure [fig:connections] illustrates their interconnections.
Section [sec:Distributed~R~oadmap] summarizes the outlook.
