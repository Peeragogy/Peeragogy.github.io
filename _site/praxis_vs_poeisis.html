    <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4>

<p>Peer production, as the name indicates, is about “making stuff.” And
making stuff can be fun and worthwhile. But we should also ask
ourselves, how much new stuff do we really need? Is there something
around that we could already use? There’s not a hard and fast answer to
this question.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>

<p>Usually we end up working at both levels – for example, writing
something new using an existing wiki, or creating a piece of software
that builds on someone else’s API. Sometimes we have to dig deeper, and
recreate a system in a more bottom-up fashion. The main issue at stake
is to try to become clear about where you do and do not need to start
from scratch (and also, be aware of the fact that we almost never really
start from scratch).</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>

<p>A lot of “learning” is really “remix” – that is, reuse and recycling of
other people’s ideas and techniques. Understanding and negotiating the
tension between reuse and creativity is the key to the art of remix!</p>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges:</h4>

<p>We’ve had interesting conversations recently about the role of open
source software in peeragogy. Most project participants agree that the
open source ideals are more important than strictly using open source
software for everything. Some feel that it would be best if we create an
open source alternative for any proprietary systems we use. The debate
has been an interesting and largely fruitful one: it’s mentioned here to
point out that there’s usually no one right answer to “reuse” questions.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next:</h4>

<p>“Platform” debates can be frustrating but can also add something to a
project in the long term, since they help people become aware of their
priorities. As mentioned in
the<a href="http://peeragogy.org/patterns/newcomer/">Newcomer</a> pattern,
developing a more clear picture of the activities that we engage in in
the project will help make it comprehensible to others. It will also be
useful for us to have a clearer picture of what we do, and what we make.</p>

as distinct from poesis which designates fabrication. Only the former,
which plays and acts, but does not produce, is noble.”
