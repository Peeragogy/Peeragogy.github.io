    <h1 id="creating-a-guide">Creating a guide</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>Meaning-carrying tools, like handbooks or maps, can help collect content
and stories as well as assist others who want to adopt the idea.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Established ideas have knowledge cartography challenges for newcomers,
consider trying to decipher a subway map in a foreign city. When the
idea or system is only “newly discovered”, the associated meanings may
not be well understood, and indeed they may not have been created. Even
if a topic is only “personally new”, it can be hard to find one’s way
around.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>The process of creating the guide can go hand-in-hand with figuring out
how the system works. Thus, techniques of <a href="http://knowledgecartography.org/">knowledge
cartography</a> and <a href="http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-47/two.html">meaning
making</a>
are useful for would-be guide creators.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>It is important to keep in mind how “the map is not the territory,” and
map-making is only one facet of shared human activity. For instance, a
pattern description can be thought of as a “micro-map” of a specific
activity. These maps are not useful if they are divorced from practice.
The process of creating a guide creates a certain formality to the
project, forcing participants to catalogue and explicate their idea.
Additionally, the act generally leads to deadlines which can help prod
individuals to work on the project more regularly.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>Writing down this pattern clarifies the importance of creating a guide
for your idea if you want others to adopt it for use.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> If people
complain that they are confused, now we know why.</p>

      <p>We started the Peeragogy project by collaboratively making an
outline for the Peeragogy Handbook. We recommended this
handbook-making practice to others, as a way to learn
collaboratively and build a strong group. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">Richard
Stallman</a> wrote about
free software documentation: “The biggest deficiency in free
operating systems is not in the software—it is the lack of good free
manuals that we can include in these systems. Many of our most
important programs do not come with full manuals. Documentation is
an essential part of any software package; when an important free
software package does not come with a free manual, that is a major
gap.” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Regarding connections with programming per se: we are not
currently making software in the Peeragogy project, but we do
continually evaluate and assemble software tools to support our
activities. We often run into “bottleneck” problems; see
<span><strong>Carrying capacity</strong></span>. The better we are able to
exposit the problems we’re dealing with, the more likely it is that
our high-level analysis (and synthesis) has the potential to inform
future programming work. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
