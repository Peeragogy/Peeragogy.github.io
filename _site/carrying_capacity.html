    <h1 id="carrying-capacity">Carrying capacity</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>There’s only so much any one person can do in a project.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>At times, a facilitator or participant in the peer-learning enterprise
may feel he or she is over-contributing – or, perhaps more likely, that
others are under-contributing – or that someone else is railroading an
idea or dominating the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>If this happens, take a step back and observe the dynamics of
involvement. Ask questions and let others answer. Especially if you
start to feel the symptoms of burnout, seek a more sustainable level of
engagement. Lead by presenting a good example – and make sure it’s
someplace you, and others, actually want to go! This could be a good
time to revisit the group’s and see if you can figure out and clarify to
others what concrete goal you’re working towards. Remember that you can
also change the “landscape” by making it easier for other people to get
involved – for example, by explaining what you’re trying to do in a
clear manner. Be on the look out for opportunities to step back, watch,
and listen. Try to be mindful of phases when active or quiet involvement
would be more helpful to the individual and the group. It’s also helpful
to let anyone who has taken on a facilitation role know if you’re
stepping back temporarily. Then, when the time is right, step back in
and get to work!</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>Even though your project may be very important, you won’t always make it
go better by working harder.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>This pattern serves as a good reminder for anyone who believes him- or
herself to be caring more about project outcomes than other
participants. Investigate why this is. Are you all affected by the
outcomes in the same way? Working smart requires you to focus on your
own goals, while relating to others who may have a different outlook,
with different, but hopefully still compatible goals.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>This pattern catalog has been rewritten in a way that should make it
easy for anyone to add new patterns. Making it easy and fruitful for
others to get involved is one of the best ways to redistribute the load
(compare the pattern).</p>
