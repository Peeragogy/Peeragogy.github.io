    <h1 id="welcome-to-the-peeragogy-workbook">☞ Welcome to the Peeragogy Workbook!</h1>

<p>This booklet is designed to introduce you to our fun, exciting world
of peer learning and peer production!!  You may already be familiar
with these terms, or they may be new to you. Either way, don’t
worry!!!</p>

<p>If they are new, consider the following 2 examples.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Peer learning</em>: Joe Corneli needs to get from the suburbs of
Chicago to the north side of the city.  He gets on the commuter train
and transfers to the purple “L” at Davis Street in Evanston. He plans
to change to the red line at Howard Street, but the train says “Loop”
and he asks another passenger whether it will stop at Howard. She says
it will, but that he can save an hour of his time by riding express to
the city and then coming back two stops!  Joe makes it to his meeting
with Charlie with plenty of time to spare.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Peer production</em>: Two cavewomen see lightning strike a tree and
produce fire! Walking up to it they notice the heat and think
“Wouldn’t it be nice to have fire for our family at night!” Once the
rain clears, they find some dry sticks and start working together to
figure out how they can use them to start their own flame. After hours
of trial and error, BOOM they’ve got fire!  The news travels fast. :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Peeragogy is an approach to learning and working together on projects
ranging from the mundane to the monumental.  Peer learning and peer
production are probably as old as humanity itself, but they take on
new importance in the digital age.</p>

<p>The   Peeragogy   Project   is   an   informal   learning   project   with
members worldwide. Three members of the project share their
welcoming messages below.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa Snow MacDonald</strong>:   Welcome to peeragogy! It’s kind of a
weird name, but it’s enormously powerful in providing to you
some understanding of other ways of working together. </p>

<p><strong>Dorotea Mar</strong>:  Your   contributions   would   be   really   welcome   if
you   participate   respectfully   and   harmoniously   with   other
peers.   It   can   change   your   life   and   improve   your   well­being
and make everything better.</p>

<p><strong>Paola Ricaurte Quijano</strong>:  Welcome to the Peeragogy Project!
We are a group of enthusiastic people that love to learn and
are trying to find the best ways to learn together.</p>

<h1 id="a-peeragogy-interview">A Peeragogy Interview</h1>

<h2 id="introductions">Introductions</h2>

<p><strong>Paola Ricaurte Quijano</strong>: Hi! I’m Paola, I’m from Ecuador. I work at
Tecnológico de Monterrey, a private university in Mexico City, and I
love to learn with everybody! </p>

<p><strong>Dorotea Mar</strong>: Hello.  I’m in Berlin now and I really like the
peeragogical atmosphere of collaboration and I think we are really
improving ways of collaboration and peer production, so that’s why I’m
here.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa Snow MacDonald</strong>: Hello. This is Lisa from Los Angeles. My
background is media psychology and I’m interested in peeragogy as it
relates to business.</p>

<p><em>What is peer learning/production?</em></p>

<p><strong>PRQ</strong> Well, peer learning. learning with peers, learning from peers
and trying to make things together or make things happen together.  I
think that for me, the most important thing I’ve learned from this
experience is that you can achieve more when you work together and set
goals together.</p>

<!--
**LSM** I think peer learning and peer production are unstructured ways
for people to come together to pool their relative strengths to
achieve results that might not be achieved if they were working
individually on their respective sections and then trying to assemble
them.

**DM** I'm still trying to find out.  i thought the answer to this
question was clear to me when I joined the Peeragogy Project and then
I realized there is so much more to this. When we're learning together
there are so many other processes happening and they are integral
processes of learning together. I think the answer is I'm still trying
to find out.

**PRQ** Yeah, I think Dorotea is right. I think that the process is the
goal. And the emotional relationships that you build during the
process are also important.
-->

<p><strong>LSM</strong> I think what peeragogy does is it allows us to recognize the
value of those connections. A lot of other ways of working are more
individualized. It goes back to a concept of 1 + 1 = 2, which is very
rational and very measured and is kind of a dominant way of thinking
in our society today, whereas peer to peer learning and production
recognize the value of those connections.  You may not be able to
measure it with a yardstick, but we understand that there is value in
those connections.  So it’s basically acknowledging that when it comes
to learning/collaborative environments if constructed the right way if
working well it can be 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 = 4. That type of situation,
which is really different from the way we’re used to thinking about
things. And I think that’s really the value of what we’re doing and
the potential of what we could hopefully unlock.</p>

<p><em>More specifically, what is peeragogy and/or what is the Peeragogy Project?</em></p>

<p><strong>PRQ</strong> This is a project that began spontaneously. We didn’t have a
plan at the beginning. We just talked about the things that concerned
us the most.  What do you need if you want to learn with others, how
to learn better? what do you want to learn? Where do you want to
learn? When do you want to learn? Basic questions that can be answered
in many ways.  We don’t have a strict line. We have a map, maybe, but
a map that can be walked through by many different paths.
Paths that you choose can be related to the people you are working
with. I think it’s been a great experience for us. As Lisa said, we
have been recognizing the talents and strengths of every person that
has contributed and participated in this project.</p>

<p><strong>LSM</strong> OK. I’ll take my best shot with this. Going back to what I said
earlier and building off what other people have said.  Because we
don’t have a good mental construct in our heads as far of how this
works and measurement is difficult.  We haven’t learned how to measure
these connections.  I think what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project
can do is it can establish what people have said about focusing on the
process.  It can help people understand the process better.  Because
this lack of structure can be uncomfortable for people.  We need to
understand when that discomfort is acceptable, so they don’t revert
and become counter­ productive participants in the process.  The map
analogy is really good too that Paola just mentioned.  It’s not about
providing a direct path. If you’re on a trip trying to get from LA to
Chicago, there’s many paths you can take.  It’s making sure you’re
monitoring your resources and you’re taking care of things along the
way. You can drift off course. 1 + 1 can equal 0 if things don’t work
out well.  So, what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project can do is
provide some structure and framework around the unstructured way that
things can be done, so people trying to make sure it’s constructive
and beneficial have some guidelines and some things to watch out for.</p>

<h2 id="example-howard-rheingold-grows-a-learning-network">Example: Howard Rheingold Grows a Learning Network</h2>

<p>“When I started using social media in the
classroom, I looked for and began to learn from more experienced
educators.  First, I read and then tried to comment usefully on their
blog posts and tweets.  When I began to understand who knew what in
the world of social media in education, I narrowed my focus to the
most knowledgeable and adventurous among them.  I paid attention to
the people the savviest social media educators paid attention to. I
added and subtracted voices from my attention network, listened and
followed, then commented and opened conversations.  When I found
something I thought would interest the friends and strangers I was
learning from, I passed along my own learning through my blogs and
Twitter stream. I asked questions, asked for help, and eventually
started providing answers and assistance to those who seemed to know
less than I. The teachers I had been learning from had a name for what
I was doing — “growing a personal learning network.” So I started
looking for and learning from people who talked about HOW to grow a
“PLN” as the enthusiasts called them.”</p>

<hr />

<!--
**DM** For me peeragogy is really a great experience. I think the way
we do things we are going beyond any collaborative project
basically. We allow so much freedom/openness in the Project. Everyone
is welcome, basically.  Anyone can just jump in and propose something
and this will somehow fit in. And this is quite amazing for me. Over
the last year it will just be really creative.  We don't really have
any restrictions. People can join from anywhere in the world, like
today I was cooking and that was OK. So I think that's really nice,
the atmosphere, the relationships and the mutual respect we have for
each other and appreciation. This is really important.

**PRQ**    I think that when we began this we were thinking about a
new   pedagogy   of   learning   with   others,   so   that's   what
peeragogy   is,   a   new   way   of   seeing   and   collaborating   and
learning in open spaces and spaces that are not constrained
by time or space. It's an open learning environment for people
that   are   driven   by   self­motivation   of   going   somewhere   with
some others.
-->

<p><em>How do you do peeragogy?</em></p>

<!--
**LSM** That's a good question. I've been thinking more about how you
create a culture of peeragogy.  It can tend to be a natural extension
of the way in which people behave. If the culture/environment is
created around a group of people they will tend to participate in that
way. I'm not sure if you say I wanna do peeragogy I'm not sure how to
respond to that actually. Except I'd want a loose structure, I'm not
sure.
-->

<p><strong>DM</strong> I think I do a lot of peeragogy and I’m very happy about it
because I learn so much from my group and from myself in this group
that I like to apply it to other projects that I’m in or all the
co­working/co­living projects or anything basically. Especially the
principle of mutual respect that is still remaining after a very long
time. And the really nice relating to each other.  The main principle
is mutual respect and openness, mutual space not constrained by
time/space. And the process. And what I meant by the details, in each
detail there is value that we promote.
Let’s say how we manage the Peeragogy Page or Community (See “How to
Get Involved”, below.).  These seem to be details, but they’re
actually really important. So if we pay attention to all these, every
little thing matters, and this is how I do it. I try to be very
careful about basically everything.</p>

<h2 id="example-learner-know-thyself">Example: Learner, know thyself.</h2>

<p>When   he   joined   the   Peeragogy   project   in   2012,   Charles
Jeffrey Danoff did a brief self­evaluation about what makes
him interested in learning: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Context.  I resist being groomed for some unforeseeable future
rather than for a specific purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timing and sequence.  I find learning fun when I’m studying
something as a way to procrastinate on another pressing assignment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social reinforcement. Getting tips from peers on how to navigate a
snowboard around moguls was more fun for me than my Dad showing me the
proper way to buff the car’s leather seats on chore day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experiential awareness. In high school, it was not fun to sit and
compose a 30-page reading journal for Frankenstein. But owing in part
to those types of prior experiences, I now find writing pleasurable
and it’s fun to learn how to write better.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>PRQ</strong> I think peeragogy is more like a mind­set. I think we have to
change the way we relate to others and the way we understand the
possibilities of learning.  For example, I’m a teacher and, of course,
my teaching practice tries to support collaborative, creative
learning.  So, I expect my students to take care of their own learning
by making decisions about most aspects of the learning process.
Program their own learning goals. The Blackboards, the environments
they want to use. The activities and also the assessments.  I’m trying
to give them conditions to decide how they want to learn and what they
want to learn and how they want to learn it.  And for me it’s been a
very interesting experience. They are usually not used to making
decisions about the process in a formal environment.  At the beginning
of the semester you give them everything and usually they just follow
guidelines and criteria for the class.  I have been trying with them
to change this way of doing things. They feel insecure, because they
really do not know how or what they want to do. So, that process of
making decisions together is very rich and very meaningful for
everybody.</p>

<!--
**DM** This for us was like a workshop so that we also learn how to be
more peeragogical, and I think we're extending it to all the domains
of our life. I think this is really nice, it's almost like we are
self­coaching each other in being more collaborative and this is a
very good thing for us, as well.

**PRQ** As Lisa said developing this culture of collaboration in every
environment and seeing every environment as an opportunity to learn
together.

**DM** I think we're also spreading the culture of collaboration in
some ways and this is also very beautiful to do that. This is still an
experience for us and we can also help to experience it by somehow
interacting on what comes out of this project already and still is
evolving.  The whole process of learning together. It was also a
learning process for all of us and this group. I think so, I don't
know how it was for you, but I feel like that. It helped us to create
this culture of collaboration within our group and we have transferred
it to other groups we are talking with. It became a light that is
spreading all over somehow by different channels.

**LSM** I think what she said too is important, because we often don't
have a lot of language and lots of words have double meanings. So when
we look at the concept of team, it can carry with it different
meanings.  One can be disjointed approach where everyone has specific,
different roles or there are other concepts of team where everyone is
integrated and working together.  And yet a lot of times those
differences aren't communicated directly when you're working with
groups. So we're bringing to the surface things that are often
implicit when they're working in groups and by pulling it to the
surface we're raising awareness that people are making choices and
there are these different choices in how we approach things.  Where do
you do peeragogy?

**DM** Everywhere I can. Just now in the kitchen, cooking with a
friend, I was doing peeragogy.

**LSM** I think you can do it just about anywhere.  My interest though
is as it relates to business.  How different groups and departments
work together.

**PRQ** I agree w/Dorotea. I try to peeragogy everywhere. We should find
a verb for that. I collaborate w/a group of human rights activists in
Contingentemx (http://contingentemx.net/) and I also see my
collaboration there as a peeragogical practice. When you are in a
family you should understand you are a team, and if you don't see
every member as a valuable contributor to the common goals of that
team it doesn't work.

<h2 id="example-metacognition-and-mindfulness">Example: Metacognition and Mindfulness</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alan Schoenfeld: “What (exactly) are you doing? Can you describe it
precisely?  Why are you doing it?  How does it fit into the solution?
How does it help you?  What will you do with the outcome when you
obtain it? ” [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p><em>When do you do peeragogy?</em></p>

<p><strong>DM</strong> I think always.  I really like that during the hangouts we don’t
have agendas usually.  We just get creative.
And whatever happens it’s the right thing.  We just work
together and somehow the right things happen.  I think we’re always
doing peeragogy when we do things in open, collaborative, ways if
we’re not trying to restrict it with too much structure in the
Hangouts or anything we do basically.</p>

<p><strong>PRQ</strong> I basically agree with Dorotea.  The where and when questions
are related.  If you’re thinking about where, you’re thinking about
when. So if where is everywhere, and then your when is also always, so
I agree. Anywhere, everywhere, all the time.  It’s an ongoing
process. It’s not something you can say NOW I’m applying peeragogy,
but not for others. At least from my point of view.  If you believe in
peeragogy in a sense in that sense that you believe in a way of doing
things or making things happen, you cannot shuffle or break yourself
into 2 people or 2 different persons and say I’m not working with
peeragogy now. It’s hard to split yourself in 2.</p>

<p><strong>LSM</strong> In business there are personalities, and people who will tend to
adapt and prefer a peeragogical model. They tend to be more
collaborative just by nature. Other personalities are not, and that’s
why what we’re doing here is valuable. There’s often not recognition
of these two different styles of working that’s conscious. In a
business environment it’s not necessarily voluntary and people coming
together united by a single goal. In biz you get different
personalities tossed together, so understanding these rules and
raising differences to the surface could be very valuable for the
business to make other people’s lives better in the business
environment.</p>

<!--
**DM** To pick up on what Paola said about the process.  Sometimes we
like to think in our imaginations that Peeragogy is this, but then we
realize that it's something more.  It's like process within us and how
we evolve this notion.  It means much more each time we refer to
it. It's an evolving construct. The more we do it, the more we
understand it and the broader we view the whole landscape around it
and what really matters is how we do this and what other things
matter.  It's a process also in terms of our learning and
understanding what it really is and it comes by doing it. It's
learning by doing it's also evolving notion by exploring it!

**PRQ** Yeah I agree with Dorotea in the sense that it's a dynamic,
on­going process.  It's very important to have the metacognition
process. In the sense we are always reflecting how are we doing this?
How do we want do this? What do want?  Why? Are we doing the right
thing? It's a long process in that we're always asking ourselves
things.  This process of asking ourselves questions is also a learning
process. That makes us be more aware of things that should be promoted
and things that maybe don't work that way.  Who does peeragogy?

**PRQ** Of course, we consider ourselves the peeragogy team. Not
everybody is familiar with our, let's say, strategies/beliefs. But I
think, as we said earlier if we are feeling and thinking this a good
way to solve problems and be creative, then it's a good thing to apply
to any given environment. So it's difficult if other people, different
from us, try to impose rules or define things without considering our
ideas or input. Lisa was talking about organizations. I think they
could gain a lot if they understand that peeragogy is a better way to
work in an entrepreneurial or private environment, in general, I think
it's good for all.

**LSM** I think a lot of people may not be aware of it who are working
in that sort of environment. I think we all do to some extent. Going
on social media, googling the internet for help on things, going into
chatrooms can be a kind of peeragogy of peer to peer to peer support:
a way of solving your particular problem.  I think everybody does it
on different levels, but they may not be aware of it.
-->

<p><strong>DM</strong> There are many collaborative projects that aim to do something
of this kind, but they are not as much into it as we are in a sense.
They notice something or promote something that we do also, but they do not pay
attention to other things that we consider important. Some people have
natural tendencies to be peeragogical, and some people are not so
transparent in the way they do things, but I think it’s really
beneficial, especially for collaborative projects.  Everyone can learn
a bit of that and do it if they bring more awareness to how they do
things and what they think and not just focus on some part of it, but
see things in a bigger picture in a sense, so I think people do it in
little different ways and sometimes they do the opposite, but I think
our role would be to bring more awareness to the details and
process. And if people resonate with it they can say yes it makes
sense and they can do it this way, but still I think it would help to
focus attention on all that could be done in a peeragogical way, Bring
more awareness to roles, would help to focus attention to all that
could be done in a peeragogical way and maybe is not because there’s
not enough awareness of the process. In general my answer is most
people are able to do it, but maybe they just don’t know yet.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="example-jay-cross-on-setting-sail">Example: Jay Cross on Setting Sail</h2>

<p>“If I were an instructional designer in a moribund
training department, I’d polish up my resume and head over
to marketing. Co­learning can differentiate services, increase
product   usage,   strengthen   customer   relationships,   and
reduce   the   cost   of   hand­holding.   It’s   cheaper   and   more
useful than advertising. But instead of just making a copy of
today’s boring educational practices, build something based
on interaction and camaraderie, perhaps with some healthy
competition thrown in. Again, the emphasis should always be
on learning in order to do something!” </p>

<hr />

<p><em>Why do you do peeragogy?</em></p>

<!--
**DM**       Because it feels really nice. It helps a lot with relating to
people and evolving our relationships we have in projects and
basically everywhere. It's a very healthy way of doing things
and it makes us feel good, makes others feel good. I think it's a
good thing in general.
-->

<p><strong>PRQ</strong>    Why? Well as said before, I believe in peeragogy. I believe
it’s a good way to learn. Maybe it’s the best way. 
I think I wasn’t aware of that before joining the group. I have
always been a self­learner, I have been working mostly alone.
After I began working with the group, I understood that you
grow working with a group. 
You achieve things that you aren’t able to achieve alone. I think
there’s a growing awareness of the value of collaboration in every
setting and environment.  There are more and more learning communities
everywhere in every place in the world that are also learning that are
that doing things together and deciding things together is best way
that you could be in this world! I think we are living in hard times
so we need more and more the sense that we are not alone and that we
cannot solve problems alone.</p>

<!--
**LSM**       My interest in peeragogy goes back to an experience in
business and seeing the potential benefits of it in an organization
and   seeing   those   benefits   being   stripped   away   as   new
executives   came   in   who did   not   understanding   what   they   were
stripping away. I enjoy it, see benefits because I've experience it and
seen how corrosive other ways of thinking can be to the well
being of employees and the corporation.
-->

<p><em>How did you join the Peeragogy project?</em></p>

<p><strong>PRQ</strong> How did I join? Actually after taking Howard Rheingold’s course
on Mind Amplifiers back in 2012 he invited us to join this group.  As
I said before there was not a plan, just an open question of how to
best learn with others.  That’s how it began.  We had many sessions,
discussing about many things.  The Peeragogy Handbook
(http://peeragogy.org) was the product of that process.  We have been
working with the Handbook, releasing new version every year and trying
to see what would be the best way to go farther and what would be the
future of our collaboration as a group/team?</p>

<p><strong>LSM</strong> A couple friends of mine were involved in P2P learning.  They
were invited to a conference at UCI. Howard was at the event and they
were familiar with him.  We ended up in obscure classroom and he
started talking about principles that were peeragogy related, while I
don’t know if it provided much value to my friends, it sounded a lot
like what I saw in business and he mentioned the group. So after that,
I spoke to you guys and, it’s pretty random.</p>

<p><strong>DM</strong> I think many paths led to me joining it.  I was doing research
on Open Science and I have lots of academic experiences and I always
wanted to improve the way things work and somehow I wanted to do it
and make it more creative.  I resonated a lot with the Peeragogy
Project on many levels, so somehow I just joined, I think it was
serendipity of some kind.</p>

<p>This interview was conducted on December 15th, 2014. The transcript
was edited. You can watch the whole interview online at
