    <h1 id="pattern-audit-routine">Pattern Audit Routine</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>As a collection of patterns grows, some of them may lose relevance.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Not all of the patterns are equally relevant and some will become
completely irrelevant as a project evolves.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>It is important to “tune” and “prune” the collection of patterns. Bring
a real-time aspect to debugging individual patterns using the following
five-part “<a href="http://metameso.org/~joe/docs/The-Paragogical-Action-Review.pdf">Paragogical Action
Review</a>”
@peeragogy-handbook [Chapter 28]: (1) Review what was supposed to
happen. (2) Establish what is happening/happened. (3) Determine what’s
right and wrong with what we are doing/have done. (4) What did we learn
or change? (5) What else should we change going forward?</p>

<p>After asking these five questions with respect to progress made with any
pattern, the pattern will likely become clearer and/or show its
irrelevance. Periodically run a full audit of the pattern catalog. After
a thorough review, any patterns that cannot be revised to become
relevant for our current interests can be moved to the
<span><strong>Scrapbook</strong></span>.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>We want to keep the attention focused on the most relevant issues.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>This pattern reminds us to improve our patterns, and presents a method
for refocusing.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>Regularly go through the <span><strong>Pattern Audit Routine</strong></span> in our
future meetings.</p>
