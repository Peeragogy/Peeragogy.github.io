  <p>In the context of P2P-learning, a wiki platform can be a useful and
powerful collaboration tool. This section will help you understand
what a wiki is and what it is not, why you should use it, how to
choose a wiki engine and finally how you could use it in a P2P
context. Some examples of P2P-learning projects run on wikis will help
you see the potential of the tool.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-wiki">What is a wiki?</h2>

<p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>
father of the wiki, “a wiki is a freely expandable collection of
interlinked Web ‘pages’, a hypertext system for storing and modifying
information - a database, where each page is easily editable by any user
with a forms-capable Web browser client” <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia : “a wiki is a website whose users can add,
modify, or delete its content via a web browser using a simplified
markup language or a rich-text editor” <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>.</p>

<p>You can watch this CommonCraft video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY">wiki in plain
english</a> to better
understand what a wiki is.</p>

<h2 id="what-differentiates-the-wiki-from-other-co-editing-tools">What differentiates the wiki from other co-editing tools?</h2>

<p>The previous definitions show that a wiki is a “website,” in other words
it is composed of pages that are connected together by hyperlinks.In
additiont every authorized person (not all wikis are totally open like
Wikipedia) can edit the pages from a web browser, reducing time and
space constrains. In case one saves a mistake or for any other reason
would like to go back to a previous version, a feature called “history”
allows users to see previous versions and to roll back any of them. This
version history allows also to compare versions avoiding the cluttered
of the “commentaries rainbow” we are used too in popular Word
processors. For example if you work on a wiki page, and come back later
on, you will be able to catch up by comparing your last version with the
lastest version of someone else.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google
Docs</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etherpad">Etherpad</a> are
design to enable co-editing on a single document. This can be seen as a
“wiki way” of working on a document as it is web based and includes
versioning. But it is not a wiki because a single document is not a
website. Those tools offer realtime collaboration which wikis do not and
are so far easier to use for beginners as they work
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> mode, which many
wikis do not support.  However, the advanced features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_syntax">wiki markup
language</a> make it a more
powerful tool. In summary, tools like Googles Docs or Etherpad are a
great way to quickly collaborate (synchronously, asynchronously, or a
mixture of both) on a single document for free, with a low barrier to
entry and no technical support. (Note that Etherpad does have a
“wiki-links” plugin that can allow it to be used in a more wiki-like
way; <a href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> is another real-time editing tool
that prominently features linking – and it claims to be “the best wiki
ever”.)</p>

<p>Using a real wiki engine is more interesting for bigger projects and
allows a huge number of users to collaborate on the same platform. A
wiki reduces the coordination complication as e-mails exchanges are no
more needed to coordinate a project. On the other hand it can help us
deal with complexity (<span>[</span>3<span>]</span>,
<span>[</span>4<span>]</span>) especially if you put basic simple rules
in place like the Wikipedia’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV">neutral point of
view</a> to allow every participant to
share her or his ideas.</p>

<p>Going back to the continuum we talked about before, some tools like
Moodle, SharePoint, WordPress, Drupal or others have build in wiki
features. Those features can be good but will typically not be as good
for wiki-building purposes as a well-developed special-purpose wiki
engine. In other words, those tools main focus is not the wiki, which is
only a secondary feature. When you choose a real wiki engine
like <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">Mediawiki</a>, <a href="http://www.tiki.org/">Tiki</a>, <a href="http://foswiki.org/">Foswiki</a>,
etc., the wiki will be your platform, not a feature of it. For example
if you start a wiki activity in a Moodle course, this wiki will be only
visible to a specific group of students and searchable only to those
students. On the other hand if your learning platform is a wiki, the
whole platform will be searchable to all members regarding their
permissions. We are not saying here that a wiki is better than other
tools but if you need a wiki engine to address your needs you may
consider going with a strong wiki engine rather than a “micro-wiki”
engine embedded in an other tool.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wiki">Why use a wiki?</h2>

<p>Those are the main reasons you should consider a wiki for your peer
learning projects :</p>

<ul>
  <li>To reduce coordination complication by having a central and always
up to date place to store your content. You will reduce e-mail usage
drasticly, and have access to your content from everywhere using any
operating system.</li>
  <li>To keep track of the evolution of your project and be able to view
or roll back any previous version of a wiki page using the history
feature.</li>
  <li>To make links between wiki pages to connect ideas and people but
also make links to external URL’s. This last possibility is very
handy to cite your sources.</li>
  <li>To deal with complexity. As a wiki allows anyone to contribute, if
you set some easy rules like Wikipedia’s NPOV (Neutral Point of
View), you will be able to catch more complexity as you will allow
everyone to express his or her opinion. Wikis also integrate a forum
or comment feature that will help you solve editing conflicts.</li>
  <li>To deal with work in progress. A wiki is a great tool to capture an
on going work.</li>
  <li>To support transparency by letting every members of the community
see what others are doing.</li>
  <li>To support a network structure as a wiki is by essence an horizontal
tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a hyperlinks you can…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Gérard Ayache</strong>:  “…jump by a single click from a network node to
the other, from a computer to an other, from one information to the
other, from one univers to the other, from one brain to the other.” 
(Translated from <span>[</span>5<span>]</span>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-wiki-engine">How to choose a wiki engine?</h2>

<p>You will find more than a hundred different wiki engines.</p>

<p>The first main distinction is between open source ones that are free to
download and commercial ones you will have to pay for. You will find
powerful engines on both sides open source and commercial. Sometimes the
open source ones look less polished at first sight but are backed by a
strong community and offer a lot of customization possibilities. The
commercial are sold like a package, they are nicely presented but often
they offer less customization on the user side and additional feature or
custom made tools will cost you an extra fee.</p>

<p>The second distinction that we can make is between wiki farms and
self-hosted wikis. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_hosting_service">wiki
farm</a> is a hosting
service you can find for both open source or commercial wikis. The goal
of those farms is to simplify the hosting of individual wikis. If you
don’t want to choose a wiki farm hosting, you will have to host the wiki
on your own server. This will give you more latitude and data privacy
but will require more technical skills and cost you maintenance fees.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/">Wikimatrix</a> web site will help you
choose the best wiki for your needs. It allows you to compare the
features of more than a hundred wiki
engines. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TopTenWikiEngines">Here</a> is the top ten
list of the best wiki engines by Ward Cunningham.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-a-wiki-be-useful-in-a-peeragogy-project">How can a wiki be useful in a peeragogy project?</h2>

<p>A wiki is a good tool collaborative projects and a specially suited for
work in progress as you can easily track changes using the history,
compare those version and if necessary roll back a previous versions. In
other words, nothing gets lost.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas about how to use a wiki in a peeragogy project :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a wiki as your learning platform</strong>. It can also
support <a href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/connectivism-practice-how-organize-a-mooc">Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs)</a>. A
wiki will help you organize your <a href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/organizing-a-learning-context">learning
context</a>.
You can choose to give access to your wiki only to the project
participants or open it to the public
like <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Using hyperlinking, you
will operationalize the theory
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivism">connectivism</a> by
connecting nodes together. As a learning platform wikis are powerful
because you can easily see what others are doing, share with them,
get inspired, merge ideas or link to ideas. In other words, it
creates emulation between learners. For additional ressources about
wiki in education follow this
Diigo <a href="http://www.diigo.com/user/regisb/wiki%20education">link</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage your peeragogy project</strong>. A wiki is an excellent tool for
project collaboration. Above all, the wiki can be a central place
for peer learners to write or link to content. Even if you use
several technologies to run your project as we did to write this
handbook, at the end of the day, all the content can be centralized
on a wiki using direct writing on wiki pages or hyperlinks. This way
members can access the content from anywhere and from any device
connected to the internet using any platform or application and they
will always see the most recent version while being able to browse
through the versions history to understand what has changed since
their last visit.</li>
  <li><strong>Publish your project</strong>. As a wiki is a website you can easily use
it to show your work to the world. Regarding web design, don’t
forget that a wiki can look way better than a Wikipedia page if you
customize it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-best-practices-when-using-a-wiki">What are the best practices when using a wiki?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cofacilitation</strong> – help each other learn, help each other
administer</li>
  <li><strong>Self-election</strong> – enable people to choose what they want to work
on, at their own pace, in their own way</li>
  <li><strong>Communication</strong> – use comment threads and talk pages to discuss
wiki changes</li>
  <li><strong>Documenting changes</strong> – most wikis enable editors to write very
brief descriptions of their edits</li>
  <li><strong>Rules</strong> – keep rules at a minimum level to avoid chaos without
constraining creativity</li>
  <li><strong>Fun</strong> – make it fun for people to contribute</li>
</ul>
