    <h1 id="newcomer">Newcomer</h1>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>A lot of “education” assumes we are speaking to a new generation. In
learning more broadly, the “audience” is often new to the topic.
Sometimes we are the <span><strong>Newcomers</strong></span>, sometimes we’re the
oldtimers.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p><span><strong>Newcomers</strong></span> can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things
to learn. They don’t know where to start.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> They may have a bunch of
ideas that the oldtimers have never considered – or they may think they
have new ideas, which are actually a different take on old ideas; see
<span><strong>Use or Make</strong></span>.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>It is good to try to become aware of what a <span><strong>Newcomer</strong></span>
needs, and what their motivations are.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <span><strong>Newcomers</strong></span>
themselves may have only a general idea about what their goals are, so
it can be helpful to add concreteness with <span><strong>A Specific
Project</strong></span>.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p><span><strong>Newcomers</strong></span> in the Peeragogy project have often
complained about feeling confused about what the project is about,
suggesting that our <span><strong>Roadmap</strong></span> has not been sufficiently
clear. Some feel it is too theoretical, which suggests we need to do
more work on <span><strong>Creating a guide</strong></span> on ways to get involved,
while also making it clear that we do not have an exhaustive list in
mind. New ideas can prompt us to consider how we may have been limiting
ourselves.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>The frustration and confusion felt by a <span><strong>Newcomer</strong></span>
familiar to anyone who is starting something new. An awareness of how to
help <span><strong>Newcomers</strong></span> can help us be more compassionate to
ourselves and others.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>

<p>A more detailed (but non-limiting) “How to Get Involved” walk-through in
text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing
some of the things we’re learning about.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>Peeragogy Project participant Régis Barondeau: “I joined this
handbook project late, making me a ‘newcomer’. When I started to
catch up, I rapidly faced doubts: Where do I start? How can I help?
How will I make it, having to read more than 700 posts to catch up?
What tools are we using ? How do I use them? Etc. Although this
project is amazingly interesting, catching the train while it
already reached high speed can be an extreme sport. By taking care
of newcomers, we might avoid losing valuable contributors because
they don’t know how and where to start, and keep our own project on
track.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Peeragogy Project participant Charlotte Pierce: “Joe was working a
lot on the book, and I thought ‘this is interesting hard work, and
he shouldn’t have to do this alone.’ As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was
kindly welcomed and mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I
asked naive questions and was met with patient answers, guiding
questions, and resource links. Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself
into a position to contribute to the workflow by editing the live
manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity.” <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Dilrukshi Gamage, Julia Echeverria, and Federico Monaco first
joined a Peeragogy hangout in February, 2015. They were all
interested in the idea of designing and running a course on peer
learning. Although we had done some work on a syllabus, and
considered the notion of using peeragogical models in formal
education, we hadn’t tried running a course on the topic of
peeragogy. There were a number of earlier experiments that <em>used</em>
ideas from peeragogy inside of a formal course, and the difference
between these two approaches prompted interesting discussions. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Business issues relevant to the Peeragogy project, how to run a
MOOC, hot-syncing our website from Git, etc. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
