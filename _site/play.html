    <p>Once more we’re back to the question, “What makes learning fun?” There
are deep links between play and learning. Consider, for instance, the
way we learn the rules of a game through playing it. The first times we
play a card game, or a physical sport, or a computer simulation we test
out rule boundaries as well as our understanding. Actors and
role-players learn their roles through the dynamic process of
performance. The resulting learning isn’t absorbed all at once, but
accretes over time through an emergent process, one unfolding further
through iterations. In other words, the more we play a game, the more we
learn it.</p>

<p>In addition to the rules of play, we learn about the subject which play
represents, be it a strategy game (chess, for example) or simulation of
economic conflict. Good games echo good teaching practice, too, in that
they structure a single player’s experience to fit their regime of
competence (cf. Vygotsky’s zone of proximal learning, a la Gee
<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>). That is to say a game challenges players
at a level suited to their skill and knowledge: comfortable enough that
play is possible, but so challenging as to avoid boredom, eliciting
player growth. Role-playing in theater lets performers explore and test
out concepts; see Boal <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>. Further, adopting
a playful attitude helps individuals meet new challenges with
curiousity, along with a readiness to mobilize ideas and practical
knowledge. Indeed, the energy activated by play can take a person beyond
an event’s formal limitations, as players can assume that play can go on
and on <span>[</span>3<span>]</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Douglas Thomas and John Seely Brown</strong>: “All systems of play are, at
base, learning systems.” <span>[</span>4<span>]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Games have always had a major social component, and learning plays a key
role in that interpersonal function. Using games to build group cohesion
is an old practice, actually a triusm in team sports.</p>

<p>It is important to locate our peeragogical moment in a world where
gaming is undergoing a renaissance. Not only has digital gaming become a
large industry, but gaming has begun to infiltrate non-gaming aspects of
the world, sometimes referred to as “gamification.” Putting all three of
these levels together, we see that we can possibly improve co-learning
by adopting a playful mindset. Such a playful attitude can then mobilize
any or all of the above advantages. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two friends are learning the Russian language together. They invent
a vocabulary game: one identifies an object in the world, and the
other must name it in Russian. They take turns, each challenging the
other, building up their common knowledge.</li>
  <li>A middle-aged man decides to take up hiking. The prospect is
somewhat daunting, since he’s a very proud person and is easily
stymied by learning something from scratch. So he adopts a “trail
name”, a playful pseudonym. This new identity lets him set-aside his
self-importance and risk making mistakes. Gradually he grows
comfortable with what his new persona learns.</li>
  <li>We can also consider the <strong>design</strong> field as a useful kind of
playful peeragogy. The person <em>playing the role</em> of the designer can
select the contextual frame within which the design is performed.
This frame can be seen as the <em>rules</em> governing the design, the
artifact and the process. These rules, as with some games, may
change over time. Therefore the possibility to adapt, to tailor
one’s activities to changing context is important when designing
playful learning activities. (And we’ll look at some ways to design
peer learning experiences next!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, “game-based learning” can be part of standard pedagogy too.
When peers create the game themselves, this presumably involves both
game-based learning and peer learning. Classic strategy games like
<a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?MythOfOrigin">Go</a> and
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chess-Success-Using-Strengths-Children/dp/0767915682">Chess</a>
also provide clear examples of peer learning practices: the question is
partly, what skills and mindsets do our game-related practices really
teach?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Socrates</strong>: “No compulsory learning can remain in the soul …In
teaching children, train them by a kind of game, and you will be able
to see more clearly the natural bent of each.”</p>

<h3 id="exercises-that-can-help-you-cultivate-a-playful-attitude">Exercises that can help you cultivate a playful attitude</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <a href="http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/">Oblique Strategies</a>
card deck (Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, 1st edition 1975, now
available in its fifth edition) to spur playful creativity. Each
card advises players to change their creative process, often in
surprising directions.</li>
  <li>Take turns making and sharing videos. This online collaborative
continuous video storytelling involves a group of people creating
short videos, uploading them to YouTube, then making playlists of
results. Similar to <a href="http://clipkino.info/">Clip Kino</a>, only online.</li>
  <li>Engage in theater play using Google+ Hangout. e.g. coming together
with a group of people online and performing theatrical performances
on a shared topic that are recorded.</li>
</ul>
