<p>—#### Definition:</p>

<p>It is very useful to have an up-to-date public roadmap for the project,
a place where it can be discussed and maintained. The Roadmap exists as
an artifact with which to share current, but never complete,
understanding of the space.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem:</h4>

<p>Without a roadmap, there will not be a shared sense of the project’s
goals or working methods. It will be much harder for people to volunteer
to help out, or to assess the project’s progress.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution:</h4>

<p>Keeping a list of current and upcoming activities, as well as goals and
working methods can help
<a href="http://peeragogy.org/practice/heuristics/newcomer/">newcomers</a> and
old-timers alike see where they can jump in. As we cross things off the
list, this gives a sense of the accomplishments to date, and any major
challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the Peeragogy project, once the handbook’s outline became fairly
mature, we could use it as a roadmap, by marking the sections that
are “finished”, marking the sections where editing is currently
taking place, and marking the stubs (possible starting points for
future contributors). After this outline matured into a real <a href="http://peeragogy.org/table-of-contents/">table
of contents</a>, we started to
look in other directions for things to work on, and created a
<a href="http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-org-roadmap/">roadmap for further development of the website and peeragogy
project as a whole</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be a certain roadmappiness to “presentation of self”, and
you can learn to use this well. For instance, when introducing
yourself and your work to other people, you can focus on highlights
like these: “<em>What is the message behind what you’re doing?</em>” “<em>How
do you provide a model others can follow or improve upon?</em>” “<em>How
can others get directly involved with your project?</em>”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="challenges">Challenges:</h4>

<p>Unless the roadmap is easy for people to see and to update, they are not
likely to use it. In the Peeragogy Accelerator phase of the project,
we’ve included a roadmap in the “behind the scenes” version of our
landing page, we’re using it as a way to link to other documents we’re
working on. Accordingly, people participating in the accelerator
frequently encounter the roadmap as a “first level” object. All of this
said, sometimes it’s impossible to know in advance what will happen! A
roadmap that’s not quite right will feel burdening. Sometimes it’s
better to become more open to the unknown.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next:</h4>

<p>Adding “What’s Next” steps to our patterns gives us a “distributed
roadmap.” And this works both ways: If we sense that something needs to
change about the project, that’s a clue that we might need to record a
new pattern.</p>
