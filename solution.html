various problems using patterns that we’ve encountered time and time
again in the Peeragogy project.</span></p><p><span>You can use the patterns as a starter-kit for your own experiments
with peeragogy.  Sharing – and revising – patterns is one of the key
activities we do in the peeragogy project, and you will likely want to
revisit this chapter several times as you look through the rest of the
book.  Don’t forget your pen or pencil to tailor the patterns to your
own needs; or, if you have the opportunity, jump into the discussion
online to improve the patterns for others.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="next-steps"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Next steps</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="back-‘patternize’-the-major-sections"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>BACK ‘Patternize’ the major sections</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#handbook">handbook</a></span></span></h2><section><p><span>Each of the major subsections — Convening, Organizing, Cooperation,
