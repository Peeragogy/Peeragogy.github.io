For teachers reading this, and wondering how to use peeragogy to improve
participation in their classrooms, it’s really quite simple: reframe the
educational vision using peeragogical eyes.  Recast the classroom as a
community of people who learn together, the teacher as facilitator, and
the curriculum as a starting point that can be used to organize and
trigger community engagement.  However, just because it’s simple doesn’t
mean it’s easy!  Whatever your day job may be, consider: how well do the
various groups you participate in work together – even when the members
ostensibly share a common purpose?  Sometimes things tick along nicely,
and, presumably, sometimes it’s excruciating.  What’s your role in all
of this?  How do *you* participate?

Guidelines for participation
----------------------------

-   Accept that some people want to watch what is going on before
    jumping in. This doesn’t mean you have to keep them hanging around
    forever. After a while, you may un-enroll people who don’t add any
    value to the community. In our Peeragogy project, we’ve asked people
    to explicitly re-enroll several times. Most do renew; some leave.
-   Accept that people may only contribute a little: if this
    contribution is good it will add value to the whole.
-   Understand that you can not impose strict deadlines on volunteers;
    adjust targets accordingly.
-   Let your work be “open” in the sense described in
    Wikipedia’s [Neutral Point of
    View](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) policy.
-   Give roles to participants and define some “energy centers” who will
    take the lead on specific items in the project.
-   Organize regular face-to-face or online meetings to talk about
    progress and what’s needed in upcoming days/weeks.
-   Ask participants to be clear about when they will be ready to
    deliver their contributions.
-   Have clear deadlines, but allow contributions that come in after the
    deadline – in general, be flexible.
-   Add a newcomer section on your online platform to help new arrivals
    get started. Seasoned participants are often eager to serve as
    mentors.

When we think about project management in an organization, we often
relate to well-established tools and processes. For example, we can use
the [Project Management Body of
Knowledge](http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx) (PMBOK) as
a standard. For the Project Management Institute (PMI) and many workers,
these standards are seen as the key to project success. In classical
project management, tasks and deadlines are clearly defined. We will,
for example, use [Program Evaluation and Review
Technic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PERT) (PERT) to analyze and
represent tasks. We often represent the project schedule using a [Gantt
chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart). Those are just two of
the project management tools that illustrate how “mainstream” project
management rests firmly on an engineering background. In these very
structured projects, each actor is expected to work exactly as planned
and to deliver his part of the work on time; every individual delay can
potentially lead to a collective delay.

Peeragogy projects may be, naturally, a bit different from other
settings, although we can potentially reuse both formal and informal
methods of organization.  For example, unlike a typical wiki – or
classroom – peeragogy projects often expect to break the [90/9/1
rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29). Keep
in mind that some participants may not contribute all the time – but one
really good idea can be a major contribution.  See the anti-pattern
“[Misunderstanding
Power](http://peeragogy.org/practice/antipatterns/misunderstanding-power/)”
for some further reflections on these matters.

How are we doing? If we consider our basic population to be those in our Google+ community, then as of January 2014, over 4%
have contributed to the handbook – pretty good.  However, we have yet to reach a
contribution profile like 70/20/10. It’s important to remember that –
especially in a volunteer organization – no one can “make”’ other people
participate, and that all the lists of things to do are for nought if no
one steps in to do the work.  For this reason, if anything is going to
happen, what’s needed are *realistic* estimates of available work
effort. Finally, in closing this section, we want to emphasize that
measures of participation offer only a very rough proxy for measures of
learning, although the two are clearly related.
