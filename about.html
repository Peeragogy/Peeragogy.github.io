(</span><a class="firn-external" href="https://clalliance.org/blog/toward-peeragogy/" target="_blank">https://clalliance.org/blog/toward-peeragogy/</a><span>). Here is a video in
which Howard describes how he went from organising co-teaching in his
classes at Berkeley and Stanford, to running collaborative courses
online, to convening a group of people to collect practical know-how
about how to learn any subject </span><strong><span>without</span></strong><span> teachers: </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://youtu.be/dHvGIX2Wjss?t=138" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/dHvGIX2Wjss?t=138</a></p><p><span>The </span><strong><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></strong><span> is the “the no-longer-missing guide to peer
learning & peer production.”  We decided to early on to publish our
book directly in to the public domain, via the CC Zero waiver, so that
we could minimise friction for people adopting and adapting the
contents (</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.peeragogy.org/license" target="_blank">http://www.peeragogy.org/license</a><span>). We are currently working
on the 4th Edition of the book, which will bring a lot of changes to
the contents (the 3rd Edition was published in 2016).</span></p></section></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/index">index</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body></html>
