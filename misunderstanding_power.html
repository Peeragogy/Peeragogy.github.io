  language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely
  proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most
  frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second
  most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent
  word, etc. [1]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Related formulations, called power laws, model the</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www2.econ.uu.nl/users/marrewijk/geography/zipf/index.htm" target="_blank">size

someone say (or said ourselves) "wouldn't it be great if this energy
could be sustained all year 'round?" Or in a classroom or peer
production setting, wondered why it is that everyone does not
participate equally. "Wouldn't it be great if we could increase
participation?" But participation in a given population will fall off
according to some power law (see Introduction to Power Laws in</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.theuncertaintyprinciple.danoff.org/v2i3.html" target="_blank">The
Uncertainty Principle, Volume II, Issue 3</a><span>). It would be an illusion to
assume that everyone is coming from a similar place with regard to the
various literacies and motivations that are conducive to participation.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="(bogus)-solution:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>(Bogus) Solution:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>It can be tempting to adopt a "provisionist" attitude, and say: "If we

may be able to change the "exponent" in the power law. But even so,
"equality" remains a largely abstract notion. Note, also, that
participation in a given activity tends to fall off over time. It's easy
to imagine writing a hit song or a best selling novel, but hard to pull
this off, because it takes sustained effort over time. See the

typically "satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because
it dictates the way they think about programs" -- so too are people
often "satisfied" with their social environments, because these tend to
dictate the way they think and act in life. Nevertheless, if we put our
minds to it, we can become more "literate" in the patterns that make up
our world and the ways we can effect change.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="references:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>References:</span></span></h1><section><ol><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zipf%27s_law&amp;oldid=575709945" target="_blank">Zipf's
