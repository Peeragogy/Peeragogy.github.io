Brainstorming meeting with 4 people in Authorea (Marketers, CEO, Deyan). “Why are we
doing what we’re doing, why did we start this thing!”... 45 minutes in had a great list of
community serving things, then reminded that one of the purposes was to ​ make a lot of
money . ​
We come here often with an ​ academic mindset ​ ?
Vitor + Deyan: Business model canvas...? ; ​ Lean startup ; Start-up Own Manual
Ray: What is the market ready for. In academia you do research at the edge of what’s
possible. In the practical world “yes this is good cutting edge research but it’s not ready
for production...”

Vitor: we have a lot of hackathons where people present ideas that the market does not
yet want.
Joe: this is a complex thing, not ‘rapidly’ commercialisable (and I didn’t have the startup
mindset).
Vitor: “A lot of startups need to be scalable, fast growing, pain that serves a lot of
people.” — That’s how you say “where your margin comes from.” If you don’t have to
add many people or costs per margin, then you have a great margin. Adding teachers
per margin.
Deyan: you’re either inside academia or business!
Ray: There are multiple kinds of businesses, not funded by VC
Cameron: If you’re not building something that’s sustainable in the long term you’re not
doing it right. Sustainable org ideas. — JC: B-Corp book.
If you really have an idea you can execute, do you want to offer equity at that price? They
would get to diversify their portfolio and invest early on... but from the perspective of someone
trying to find a price on the open market... it may not really benefit the idea of learning from
scratch. So think much more strategically about whether the thing you’re selling them by
reentering is actually useful to our. (What’s the standard raise?)
HDtP organised summer school: One of the theme was “testing things”. As PL people, you
come up with an idea, it’s a type system, you publish it. In HCI you evaluate by putting things
together with people. If we connect our prototypes to people using things — hyping things on
Twitter, getting feedback on what’s going on.
EF: looking at exporting US businesses to elsewhere. Gumtree: that was invented by a German
company called Rocket who just has under-paid junior developers & hack things together and
they are billionaires.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What did we learn or change?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>JC: I learned a lot of business stuff but also what else there is to learn.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Got a business model and business plan.

Vitor, Analua talking about other models. Make an NGO? Partnerships?
We did get $10K+ from cloud providers
“Whitepaper” is pretty crappy but we could maybe turn it into a survey paper, for those
interested
(write or find) AI Review paper: “Advances in Natural Language Processing in Sentiment
Analysis”
“Advances in tutoring systems for programming” (or just production systems for tutor
systems for programming)

“Advances in knowledge mining from technical documents” — these exist (but are they
starting to become applicable)?
It was awkward to have a mismatch between the startup incubator and people that know
each other.
What even would be the vision that we would present? With the possibility to reset? It’s hard to
activate the seed funding without an idea that is worth the effort.

E.g., no non-disclosure agreements; EF has the ability to invest
Joe: wants to explore other business models
Other program synthesis methods. But “mining stack exchange” would be noisy so this
might be away to prune it
Try out some educational models, just to get some experience with this. Who would be
interested? E.g., take HDtP, how would our way of teaching compare with the way
people are learning.
All previous deadlines are dissolved, now with open conversations...
Joe to get back about small print about T&C.
Possible option to re-apply with Zans... but is there a business model that’s actually
viable on that time frame??</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Noting that September 6 months (2X FT)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The other option: work half time, slowly grow it, maybe teach a course with 50 people...
Meetups are a great place to find customers
Alumni network may be a good place to get investors, maybe by cultivating relationship
with investors... but emailing them isn’t a totally secure.
You don’t pitch a product, you pitch a vision. You can get a seed round from anyone:
glass of wine​ , 1 hour conversation, then $300K in the bank. All that was pitched was
the vision. There was a slide deck not a product. If you have credentials that is
important.
“Keeping Joe fed” — is a different problem form “Having a business”. So, businesses
usually aren’t started by people who are trying to feed themselves (case of Ian).
It’s kind of an introduction: 1st, I have invisible shackles, which means I can’t participate
in any side ventures. I am someone who shares experience and interested in open
source. What I’ve been interested in the last couple years, to illustrate that I have a focus
4that hasn’t been discussed in these meetings but is very adjacent. What we’re currently
working on this year is a fresh effort for the MathML standard. In FF, Chrome, making it
accessible for text-to-speech standard. Have a working academic product, it ties into
e-learning with ​ math​ texts. The data mining is attached to this level of representation.
Very excited about anything to do with mathematics and e-learning.
○ “Let’s build a few ​ showcases​ and see what works.”
■ Compatible w/ “I’m scratching my own itch” or “I’m using it with 10
students”
■ Still, how many people can you get excited for it...! (Many of Deyan’s
ideas got shut down until they hired a designer.) — With Emacs it’s not
going to be a company, though some could be reimplemented. Emacs is
like a breadboard. But we could use it to teach someone to do
something. Put this out, advertise on Reddit or whatever, does anyone
learn from it? — This is exactly the learn startup way.
■ Once we have excited users, the business side can fall into place,
including both business & operations. ​ We have to be a bit skeptical,
but until we reach that point it’s a distraction to get too focused on
the business side. They can’t answer the questions until you’ve
achieved.
○ No shame in getting a postdoc to clear up the concepts. Find a nice topic &
investigate it, then you can make a company out of that later. Academia gives
you the comfort to investigate at leisure. In startup there’s no leisure.
Important to get through a bunch of ideas, rather than having a formal process. We can
formalise it later once we know the ideas that are being thought of at the individual level. E.g.
“the unifying idea is model construction” — start with a bit of abstraction or how to raise funding
will not be determinable.
