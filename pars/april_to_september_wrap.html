groups, and developing educational techniques. We continue to learn how
face-to-face interaction (online video conferencing in this case) goes a long
way towards building understanding, open mindsets, and empathy.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-are-some-different-perspectives-on-what’s-happening?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>• It has not been a linear path over the last six months, but we feel there has
been constructive progress. We are extending our reach through media like
podcasting that makes our work more accessible to people in all walks of life
and allows us to explore our concepts over time. Arguments have emerged
that have largely been resolved through acceptance of good intentions. We
have found peeragogy can tolerate disagreement, conflict, and/or value dif-
ferences.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What did we learn or change?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>• We learned the value of managing expectations, being clear about poli-
cies and values, leaning on friends we never met in physical space, all the
while continuing to be productive during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
learned that simply sending someone over to our website or discussion group
to explain peeragogy does not result in immediate understanding about the
project. A more welcoming interface is needed. We also learned that our
initial, emotional reactions to others’ expressed values or changes in process
seldom reflect reality of others’ intentions.
• Continue to evolve, listen, and pursue opportunities 
• Think in a sustainable way to make the group self-sufficient possibly by cre-
ating sellable products (books, articles, courses, etc.) so that the group can
have more than one website and raise our visibility.
• Create an accessible “dashboard” or graphical interface that will engage non-
technical people who can benefit from the patterns and best practices.
• Take participants’ well considered proposals at face value and imagine them
being successful before rejecting or opposing them.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="5"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>5</span></span></h1><section><p><span>N/A</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
