    We expected the participants to learn more peer learning and peer production
    Develop a “product” or focus for peeragogy, “what does it do?”
    Participants and co-coordinators figure out “What’s in it for me?” with peeragogy and the course itself</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="identify-what-happened:-what-and-how-did-we-learn?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Identify what happened: what and how did we learn?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>    HOW: Video conferencing - allows for global participation

    We weren’t always “prepared” :-o
    We “kept going”
    Organized on calendar (session 6/8, etc.)
    Decided on one place to take notes - in this case it was the zoom chat
    Use of other platforms does not need to be disruptive. But it does help to have a central one that others feed into. Synchronizing different apps and platforms remains an ongoing challenge.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-else-should-we-change-going-forward?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What else should we change going forward?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>    Develop system to encourage participation

    Map out a better definition of the course - along the lines of Joe’s for Tufts pilot
    Update Rheingoldian meeting roles to have “primary” ones that should be filled first and “nice to have”
    Update the Peeragogical Action Review to account for use during an activity itself or after its completed</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
