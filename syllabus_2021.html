While these activities are widespread, the Peeragogy project is
distinctive in that it uses peer production and peer learning to study
and improve the way peer production and peer learning work.</span></p><p><span>Two practical questions we have examined in the Peeragogy project are:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>How can informal learning endeavors reflect on what they have
  accomplished?</span></p></li><li><p><span>How can they extract lessons that will improve their future
  collaboration?</span></p></li></ul><p><span>We introduce the methodology that we use, in a way that others can
leverage in their own reflections.  This article takes the form of a
syllabus for a three week, six hour course. Our intention is to run the
course once and then make it self-guided with the use of pre-recorded
materials.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="keywords"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Keywords</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Peeragogy. Peer Pedagogy. Education. Project Action Review,

made by media scholar Howard Reingold at UC Berkeley.  The project
explores Peer Learning and Peer Production, and uses these methods in
the process.  We want to find better ways to share what we have been
learning. We already give away free copies of the Peeragogy Handbook,
a collaboratively-written text. We thought: could we teach a course on
peeragogy that uses the Handbook as a course text, and that makes the
material even more accessible to more people?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="specific-objectives"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Specific objectives</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We had to resolve a central dilemma.  Since peeragogy concerns peer
learning and peer production, is it really appropriate to “teach” a
course on the subject?  Shouldn't the course be co-created together with
peers --- learning and working together --- in   order to best convey
the subject? Some of the questions we asked as we were framing this
document are:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>What's the learning outcomes?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What's actually going to happen in this course?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Will this be clear to readers within one or two pages?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Is there an existing FAQ that we can draw upon?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What are the roles that people will take on in the course?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Who are the Charlie, Ray, Joe, Vitor of the next conversation?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="problem-statement"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Problem statement</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The Peeragogy Project was convened by media scholar Howard  Rheingold in
2012, and charged with being a living resource “for any group of people
who want to learn anything.”</span></p><p><span>We would love to discuss aspects of learning and working
collaboratively! However, to be efficient, we have developed this
three-week, six-session syllabus course that serves as an introduction
to peeragogy.  We leave resources like the Peeragogy Handbook for
self-paced study. In peeragogical fashion, course participants will
be crucial to the course experience.</span></p><p><span>The course syllabus can also be read as a research report, summarising
what we have learned by studying peeragogy.  The
course will focus on methods, and we will strive to
involve members of the course as co-research-investigators for the next
experiment.  Our research question is: how effective are the methods we
have developed for people who are new to peeragogy?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="justification"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Justification</span></span></h2><section><p><span>There are various resources for learning peeragogy: the Peeragogy
Handbook, videos, papers, ongoing meetings, and others.  We want to
create a short introduction that can serve as a map or
guide to the rest of peeragogy.</span></p><p><span>Our primary hypothesis going into this short experiment is that students
who spend 2 hours a week for three weeks in course will not only have
access to the material, but that they will want to use it; and that they
will see a benefit from engaging with peeragogical practices.  This will
be assessed (1) with ongoing review of actions taken during the course
and (2) with a follow-up interview.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="methodology"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>METHODOLOGY</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="pilot-courses"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pilot Courses</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>We previously ran several small online pilot courses (add years,

students, teachers, groups of friends, communities of practice,

across an entire society! In this workshop, we put peeragogy into
action as we break into small groups and play “Flaws of the Smart
City”, a futures studies game that imagines scenarios for the
evolution of urban environments. After playing, each group will do a
Project Action Review to reflect on lessons learned. Subsequently, the
groups will present their PARs to the wider audience so everyone can
learn from their experience and extract patterns. Finally, all
attendees will "hive edit" a 500 to 1,000 word writeup of the workshop
that will be included in the upcoming fourth edition of the Peeragogy

going out for pizza. They like different toppings, but that doesn't
particularly matter, because each of them orders their own perfectly
sized Neapolitan-style pizza, and eats it with gusto. Indeed, it turns
out they like pizza so much that they would like to have it several
nights a week. Going out that frequently would be expensive, so they
erect a brick oven in their backyard and get good at making their own
pizzas at home: selecting good ingredients, fermenting the dough, and
baking at a high temperature. After some time goes by, they have gotten
really good at this, and they daydream about opening their own
restaurant. They look into some available practical guidance and adapt
it for their use case. After a lot of planning and a whole lot of work,
they get their new pizza restaurant up and running, and they are doing
good business. However, as more time goes by, they begin to notice some
stress.</span></p><p><span>System layer: Mom has practical experience of how restaurants operate
coming from summers she spent working in a diner.  Pop
is handy with tools, so he can set up and maintain
restaurant equipment.  The policies of the town are favorable to small
businesses.  The demographics of the town include a number of busy
families with children who form a reliable customer base for the
pizzeria.  As the pace of economic recovery picks up, townspeople have
more money and less time, so they frequent restaurants and order takeout
more frequently.  The restaurant maintains good connections with local
suppliers, and Mom and Pop are proud of the high-quality and affordable
dining experience they can offer.  However, they are extremely busy.</span></p><p><span>Worldview layer: Pop values self-reliance and self-cultivation. For
him, the worth of a person is determined not by
possessions, external circumstances, or social status, but by character
and accomplishments. He believes that every person has an inner purpose
and that the surest way to be happy and useful to society is to follow
one's inner voice and encourage others to do the same. Mom values
relationships and community. Her goal in life is to make the world a
better place by bringing people together and slowing down the pace of
life at least long enough to let neighbors chat and get to know each
other. Pop, inspired by historical figures like Thoreau, sees living
“off-grid” as an ideal: a way to be independent from modern
civilization, and more in touch with nature.  It can be hard for him to
reconcile his community spirit with his individualism.  Mom, on the
other hand, envisions an ideal community where healthy relationships are
facilitated over good meals.  She sees the restaurant as a way to build
relationships with diners and others in the food supply chain and local
community.</span></p><p><span>Myth layer: Pop looks up to Thoreau and Emerson as
personal heroes, and knows Walden and Self-Reliance backwards and
forwards.  Mom looks back to childhood memories of parents who loved
cooking together and her memories evoke an age of innocence.  For her,
the circle is a powerful symbol of wholeness and community: when she
brings a pizza to children at the round tables of the restaurant, she
feels like a mystagogue initiating the next generation.  They share some
of this information with a wise counsellor, who they meet in a
consulting room filled with lovely plants.  Together, they put together
a strategy that helps them to respond to the circumstances that have
evolved.  They decide to close the shop Monday through Wednesday, to
spend time away from the business.  They engage with hobbies like
writing, woodwork, and painting, and they tend their garden together.
 Thursday through Sunday, they resolidify their intention to make their
work together a meditation on love. They develop new ideas, related to
food and otherwise. Boosted by their time off, they prepare more
innovative meals and, while the restaurant remains affordable, they

edit the Peeragogy Handbook.  The tools are called Emacs, Org Mode, and
Git.  You don't need to have prior experience with them: we will teach
you everything you need to know in one hour. It is entirely acceptable
to do peeragogy or to contribute to the Peeragogy project without using
any of the tools described here. One of our guidelines in the project is
that</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Newcomers should be easily able to jump into the project and start
contributing using tools and methods that are familiar to them.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>So, if there are other tools you like better, feel free to use those
instead!  The reason we teach these tools is that we like them, and we
also think that it sets a good standard for others: if you like using
other tools, please develop a one hour workshop that teaches people how
to use them!</span></p><p><strong><span>15 minutes:</span></strong><span> Emacs</span></p><p><span>‘Emacs' stands for Editor Macros, and it is the name of a computer
program that you can use to write letters, code, or an entire book.
We're using Emacs along with other free software tools to edit the
mainline version of the Peeragogy Handbook (4th Ed.).</span></p><p><strong><span>15 minutes:</span></strong><span> Org Mode</span></p><p><span>Org mode is a ‘mode' of Emacs that is used for organising things! You
can use it to organise things into an outline, or into an agenda, or
into a wiki --- and probably in some other ways that I forgot.</span></p><p><span>        “Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as
those who love war.” --- Martin Luther King Jr.</span></p><p><strong><span>15 minutes:</span></strong><span> Git + Github</span></p><p><span>We'll teach you everything you need to know about Git and Github to edit
a copy of the Peeragogy Handbook and submit a “pull request”</span></p><p><strong><span>15 minutes:</span></strong><span> Putting it all together</span></p><p><span>Working in small groups you'll write up a short description of what you
learned and submit it to the Handbook editors, along with a copyright
waiver to allow inclusion of the material in future editions of the
Handbook.</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="final-considerations,-conclusions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS, CONCLUSIONS</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>This course has covered peer learning and peer production, using the methods of peer learning and peer production.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="acknowledgements"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We thank colleagues in the peeragogy project for discussions and
