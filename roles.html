associated with them. Everything could bifurcate from the "autodidact",
as in, (1) Autodidact, (2) Tutor-Tutee, (3) Tutor-Tutee-Peer, etc.,
until we have bursars, librarians, technicians, janitors, editors of
peer reviewed research journals, government policy makers, spin-off
industrial ventures and partnerships, and so on.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="problem:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Problem:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Even the autodidact may assume different roles at different points in
time - sometimes building a library, sometimes constructing a model,
sometimes checking a proof. The decomposition of "learning" into
different phases or polarities could be an endless theoretical task. The
simpler problem is to be aware of the roles that you and your teammates
have in the projects you're working on.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We've described some exercises on
