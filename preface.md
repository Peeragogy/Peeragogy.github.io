title: Preface to the Third Edition
---

This 3rd Edition of the *Peeragogy Handbook* is dedicated to one
of our most convivial -- indeed, lovable -- volunteers. George Brett
was a quiet and learned man with a sense of fun.  His mail art name
was geORge and for a while he was known by many online for the selfies
he took with his yellow rubber duckie. Far from being a full-time
funster, George has been involved in expanding the educational uses of
the Internet since before it was the Internet, both in his work with
government institutions and his many online volunteer activities. He
gifted the Peeragogy project not only with his knowledge and labor,
but with his warmth and fun.  We miss him.

The Second Edition of the *Handbook* came out two years ago.
We've kept at it since then.  This time around, we're kicking things
off with a short workbook that contains a concise guide to the who,
what, when, where, how and why of peeragogy.  We've thoroughly revised
the pattern catalog at the heart of the book, added more case studies,
and made numerous small improvements to the text (and the
typesetting!)  throughout.
