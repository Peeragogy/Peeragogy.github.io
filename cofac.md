title: Co-facilitation
---
Facilitation is a process of helping groups work cooperatively and
effectively. Facilitation can be particularly helpful for individuals
who, based on a certain level of insecurity or inexperience, tend to
lurk rather than participate. At the same time, in peeragogy, a
facilitator isn’t necessarily an “authority." Rather, facilitation work
is done in service to the group and the group dialogue and process. For
example, a facilitator may simply “hold space” for the group by setting
up a meeting or a regular series of discussions.

Co-facilitating in peer-to-peer learning
----------------------------------------

Co-facilitation can be found in collaborations between two or
more people who need each other to complete a task, for example, learn
about a given subject, author a technical report, solve a problem, or
conduct research. Dee Fink writes that “in this process, there has to be
some kind of change in the learner. No change, no learning”
<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>. Significant learning requires that there
be some kind of lasting change that is important in terms of the
learner’s life; in peeragogy, one way to measure the effectiveness of
co-facilitation is to look for a change in the peer group.

Co-facilitation roles can be found in groups/teams like basketball,
health, Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual groups, etc. For example,
self-help groups are composed of people who gather to share common
problems and experiences associated with a particular problem,
condition, illness, or personal circumstance.  There are some further
commonalities across different settings.  Commenting on the work of Carl
Rogers:

> **Godfrey Barrett-Lennard**: The educational situation which most
> effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (1) threat
> to the self of the learner is reduced a minimum, and (2)
> differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated.
> <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>

Part of the facilitator’s role is to create a safe place for learning to
take place; but they should also challenge the participants.

> **John Heron**: Too much hierarchical control, and participants become
> passive and dependent or hostile and resistant. They wane in
> self-direction, which is the core of all learning. Too
> much cooperative guidance may degenerate into a subtle kind of
> nurturing oppression, and may deny the group the benefits of totally
> autonomous learning. Too much autonomy for participants and
> laissez-faire on your part, and they may wallow in ignorance,
> misconception, and chaos. <span>[</span>3<span>]</span>

Co-facilitating discussion forums
---------------------------------

If peers are preparing a forum discussion, here are some ideas from
“[The Community Tool
Box](http://ctb.ku.edu/en/tablecontents/section_1180.aspx)”, that can be
helpful as guidelines:

-   Explain the importance of collaborative group work and make it a
    requirement.
-   Establish how you will communicate in the forum.
-   Be aware of mutual blind spots in facilitating and observing others.
-   Watch out for different rhythms of intervention.

Co-facilitating wiki workflows
------------------------------

A good place to begin for any group of co-facilitators working with a
wiki are Wikipedia’s famous “5 Pillars.”

-   Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.
-   Wikipedia writes articles from a neutral point-of-view.
-   Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and
    distribute.
-   Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil
    manner.
-   Wikipedia does not have firm rules.

Co-facilitating live sessions
-----------------------------

Learning experiences in live sessions are described in the article
[Learning Re-imagined: Participatory, Peer, Global,
Online](http://dmlcentral.net/blog/howard-rheingold/learning-reimagined-participatory-peer-global-online)
by Howard Rheingold, and many of these points are revisited in the
handbook section on [real-time
tools](http://peeragogy.org/real-time-meetings/).  But we want to
emphasize one point here:

> **Howard Rheingold**: Remember you came together with your peers to
> accomplish something, not to discuss an agenda or play with
> online tools; keep everything as easily accessible as possible to
> ensure you realize your goals.
