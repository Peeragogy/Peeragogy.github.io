represent an implicit challenge to the old "industrial" organization of
work. This new way of working appears to promise something more
resilient, more exciting, and more humane. The rhetoric has been
questioned [3,9]. In and across these "free", "open", post-modern
organizations, individual participants are learning [7] -- and that they
collectively change the methods and infrastructure as they go. Because
everyone in these projects primarily learns by putting in effort on a
shared work-in-progress, participants are more in touch with an</span><em><span>equality of intelligence</span></em><span> than an </span><em><span>inequality of knowledge</span></em><span> [4:38,
119]. At the same time, they invoke a form of friendly competition, in
which </span><em><span>the best craftmanship wins</span></em><span> [5:89].</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="forces"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Forces</span></span></h1><section><blockquote><p><span>  </span><img src="/images/threshold.png" /><span> </span><strong><span>Threshold</span></strong><span>: inclusiveness and

that can be improved to </span><em><span>better</span></em><span> empower and engage people around the
world, to develop </span><em><span>richer and more useful</span></em><span> educational content, and to
disseminate it </span><em><span>more</span></em><span> effectively -- and deploy it more
creatively.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#1" id="fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a><span> How to go about this is a difficult question, and we
don't know the answers in advance. There are rigorous challenges facing
smaller projects as well, and fewer resources to draw on. Many
successful free software projects are not particularly collaborative --
and the largest projects are edited only by a small minority of users
[2,10]. Can we work smarter together?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The act of asking "can we work smarter together?" puts learning front
and center. Peeragogy takes that "center" and distributes it across a
pool of heterogeneous relationships. Indeed, peeragogy can be understood
as an up-to-date revision of Alexander's Network of Learning [1:99]. It</span><em><span>decentralizes the process of learning and enriches it through contact
with many places and people</span></em><span> in interconnected networks that may reach
all over the world. Importantly, while people involved in a peeragogical
process may be collaborating on </span><a class="firn-internal" href="/a_specific_project">A specific project</a><span>, they don't have to
be direct collaborators outside of the learning context or co-located in
time or space. Just as theories and practices of pedagogy articulate the
transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy
articulates the way peers produce and use knowledge together
(Figure [fig:connections]).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The peeragogical approach particularly addresses the problems of small
projects stuck in their individual silos, and large projects becoming
overwhelmed by their own complexity. It does this by going the opposite
route: explicating </span><em><span>what by definition is tacit</span></em><span> and employing</span><em><span>a continuous design process</span></em><span> [8:9--10]. As Howard Rheingold remarks in the
foreword to the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span>: "What made this work? Polycentric
leadership is one key" [6:iii]. "Peer-led" shouldn't suggest that there
are no leaders: rather, it means that multiple leaders act as peers.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="resolution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Resolution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Peeragogy helps people in different projects describe and solve real
problems. If you share the problems that you're experiencing with
others, there's a reasonable chance that someone may be able to help you
solve them. Bringing a problem across the </span><strong><span>threshold</span></strong><span> of someone else's
awareness helps achieve clarity. This process can guide individual
action in ways that we wouldn't have seen on our own, and may lead to
new forms of collective action we would never have imagined possible.
People who gain experience comprehending problems together build</span><strong><span>trust</span></strong><span>. Making room for multiple right answers contributes further to
resolving the tension between generality and specificity.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="example-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example 1</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Wikipedia and its sister sites Wiktionary, Wikiversity, etc.
