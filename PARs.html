  <intention-review>
    We are on track for writing a paper for the journal “Futures”. For this meeting we wanted to look at an initial draft of the paper’s abstract, and share progress updates, and check in on tasks.
  </intention-review>
  <what-happened>
    We took <html:a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=forums&amp;srcid=MTc1NDgxMDcwODYxMTEwMjg3MTkBMDI2NjY4MzE0NTg5MDU4MzM1NDEBUlJBdEtqMEJBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI">visual notes on Miro</html:a>. Attendees: Paola Ricaurte, Vitor Bruno, Hermano Cintra, Charlotte Pierce, Ray Puzio, Joe Corneli, Charlie Danoff. We kept the meeting to one hour.
  </what-happened>
  <what-happened-perspectives>
    We realised that it would be very useful to invite Takashi Iba to a future meeting. Takashi has previously combined “design patterns” and “future studies” in this talk: <html:a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCzQM-KQ50">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCzQM-KQ50</html:a>. Charlotte Pierce has some of his publications in her personal library, so we could use some of the examples under Fair Use.
  </what-happened-perspectives>
  <learnings-changes>
    Vitor Bruno pointed out that he has an asynchronous game that works well with language learners – and we talked about what we could do with a simple pattern game. We also talked about the relationship between “design patterns” and “future studies”, realising that we might not be the first people to think about this, but there doesn’t seem to be that much written about it.
  </learnings-changes>
  <what-else-should-change-going-forward>
    We’ll review some of Takashi Iba’s published patterns, including his pattern-for-producing-patterns. Hopefully we can make a bit of progress on this before we meet him next. We’ll also hope to make some of our own cards (in the style he uses), and have a good look again at the core “futures” literature that we want to be citing &amp; building on in the paper.

(Benedict, 1946), mythologists (Campbell, 1949), historians
(Inayatullah, 1998a), and others, to understand extant social
structures. Alexander and his cohorts utilized the central property of
patterns — the fact that they recur with variations — to help design
new structures for habitation. Because ​ futures studies ​ go beyond ​
design ​ , and consider not just new structures but our entire
orientation towards the future, we were curious to explore how design
patterns might relate to this more general setting. Just as narrative
methods (Gill, 2013; Liveley, 2017; Wagner-Lawlor, 2017) have been
applied in design, and from there, reapplied in futures studies, we
have proposed that patterns can be used for futures studies.</span></p><p><span>Our main results outlined several ways in which design patterns can be
used to model future-directed activities. As we have noted, they can
also be used to promote heterogeneity of thought and behavior. Design
pattern methods could be developed further and made to interact with
macrohistorical patterns for anticipation, or combined with CLA
(Inayatullah, 2006, 1998b), to connect diverse and divergent themes
across multiple layers of experience and observation.</span></p><p><span>In reflecting on the challenges still to come, we ask: how can we
foster and cherish thoughts about the future, and connect them with
action? One broad answer is to develop a culture in which we learn
things, and share what we have learned in a way that makes that
learning maximally accessible to others, while remaining maximally
open and nondogmatic, actively promoting the diversification of
viewpoints.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="thu,-5-mar,-17:06"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Thu, 5 Mar, 17:06</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We wanted to keep learning peeragogy as part of the course</span></p><p><span>Wanted to work on paper</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="establish-what-is-happening:-what-and-how-are-we-learning?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We talked about the paper, our successes and failures and causal layered analysis

Brainstorming meeting with 4 people in Authorea (Marketers, CEO, Deyan). “Why are we
doing what we’re doing, why did we start this thing!”... 45 minutes in had a great list of
community serving things, then reminded that one of the purposes was to ​ make a lot of
money . ​
We come here often with an ​ academic mindset ​ ?
Vitor + Deyan: Business model canvas...? ; ​ Lean startup ; Start-up Own Manual
Ray: What is the market ready for. In academia you do research at the edge of what’s
possible. In the practical world “yes this is good cutting edge research but it’s not ready
for production...”

Vitor: we have a lot of hackathons where people present ideas that the market does not
yet want.
Joe: this is a complex thing, not ‘rapidly’ commercialisable (and I didn’t have the startup
mindset).
Vitor: “A lot of startups need to be scalable, fast growing, pain that serves a lot of
people.” — That’s how you say “where your margin comes from.” If you don’t have to
add many people or costs per margin, then you have a great margin. Adding teachers
per margin.
Deyan: you’re either inside academia or business!
Ray: There are multiple kinds of businesses, not funded by VC
Cameron: If you’re not building something that’s sustainable in the long term you’re not
doing it right. Sustainable org ideas. — JC: B-Corp book.
If you really have an idea you can execute, do you want to offer equity at that price? They
would get to diversify their portfolio and invest early on... but from the perspective of someone
trying to find a price on the open market... it may not really benefit the idea of learning from
scratch. So think much more strategically about whether the thing you’re selling them by
reentering is actually useful to our. (What’s the standard raise?)
HDtP organised summer school: One of the theme was “testing things”. As PL people, you
come up with an idea, it’s a type system, you publish it. In HCI you evaluate by putting things
together with people. If we connect our prototypes to people using things — hyping things on
Twitter, getting feedback on what’s going on.
EF: looking at exporting US businesses to elsewhere. Gumtree: that was invented by a German
company called Rocket who just has under-paid junior developers & hack things together and
they are billionaires.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What did we learn or change?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>JC: I learned a lot of business stuff but also what else there is to learn.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Got a business model and business plan.

Vitor, Analua talking about other models. Make an NGO? Partnerships?
We did get $10K+ from cloud providers
“Whitepaper” is pretty crappy but we could maybe turn it into a survey paper, for those
interested
(write or find) AI Review paper: “Advances in Natural Language Processing in Sentiment
Analysis”
“Advances in tutoring systems for programming” (or just production systems for tutor
systems for programming)

“Advances in knowledge mining from technical documents” — these exist (but are they
starting to become applicable)?
It was awkward to have a mismatch between the startup incubator and people that know
each other.
What even would be the vision that we would present? With the possibility to reset? It’s hard to
activate the seed funding without an idea that is worth the effort.

E.g., no non-disclosure agreements; EF has the ability to invest
Joe: wants to explore other business models
Other program synthesis methods. But “mining stack exchange” would be noisy so this
might be away to prune it
Try out some educational models, just to get some experience with this. Who would be
interested? E.g., take HDtP, how would our way of teaching compare with the way
people are learning.
All previous deadlines are dissolved, now with open conversations...
Joe to get back about small print about T&C.
Possible option to re-apply with Zans... but is there a business model that’s actually
viable on that time frame??</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Noting that September 6 months (2X FT)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The other option: work half time, slowly grow it, maybe teach a course with 50 people...
Meetups are a great place to find customers
Alumni network may be a good place to get investors, maybe by cultivating relationship
with investors... but emailing them isn’t a totally secure.
You don’t pitch a product, you pitch a vision. You can get a seed round from anyone:
glass of wine​ , 1 hour conversation, then $300K in the bank. All that was pitched was
the vision. There was a slide deck not a product. If you have credentials that is
important.
“Keeping Joe fed” — is a different problem form “Having a business”. So, businesses
usually aren’t started by people who are trying to feed themselves (case of Ian).
It’s kind of an introduction: 1st, I have invisible shackles, which means I can’t participate
in any side ventures. I am someone who shares experience and interested in open
source. What I’ve been interested in the last couple years, to illustrate that I have a focus
4that hasn’t been discussed in these meetings but is very adjacent. What we’re currently
working on this year is a fresh effort for the MathML standard. In FF, Chrome, making it
accessible for text-to-speech standard. Have a working academic product, it ties into
e-learning with ​ math​ texts. The data mining is attached to this level of representation.
Very excited about anything to do with mathematics and e-learning.
○ “Let’s build a few ​ showcases​ and see what works.”
■ Compatible w/ “I’m scratching my own itch” or “I’m using it with 10
students”
■ Still, how many people can you get excited for it...! (Many of Deyan’s
ideas got shut down until they hired a designer.) — With Emacs it’s not
going to be a company, though some could be reimplemented. Emacs is
like a breadboard. But we could use it to teach someone to do
something. Put this out, advertise on Reddit or whatever, does anyone
learn from it? — This is exactly the learn startup way.
■ Once we have excited users, the business side can fall into place,
including both business & operations. ​ We have to be a bit skeptical,
but until we reach that point it’s a distraction to get too focused on
the business side. They can’t answer the questions until you’ve
achieved.
○ No shame in getting a postdoc to clear up the concepts. Find a nice topic &
investigate it, then you can make a company out of that later. Academia gives
you the comfort to investigate at leisure. In startup there’s no leisure.
Important to get through a bunch of ideas, rather than having a formal process. We can
formalise it later once we know the ideas that are being thought of at the individual level. E.g.
“the unifying idea is model construction” — start with a bit of abstraction or how to raise funding
will not be determinable.

Here are some of his comments:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"It could be just my own limitations, but I can't really understand what the Handbook actually is or what it does."</span></p></li><li><p><span>"I think if you start a little more philosophically, a little more abstractly, even, you get them on your side right away."</span></p></li><li><p><span>"I don't think you can assume everyone is as conversant in tech and pedagogy as you, at least not in the advanced and avant garde way that you are."</span></p></li><li><p><span>"Section 3 'Section Outline' can go ...

Maybe we don't even have that clear in our own heads yet... yikes!</span></p><p><span>However, here's something we surfaced recently that seemed like the "why" of the Futures paper:</span></p><p><span>« Under the right circumstances, participants in a collaborative process can develop an articulate understanding of the constraints they face, and unlock heretofore unthought of solutions. For example, Ariyaratne (1977) tells the story of a rural group who, after 15 years of bureaucratic deadlock, was able to quickly complete an important construction project without outside investment. We are interested in understanding how this kind of breakthrough happens. To explore this theme, we will consider several different settings in which people develop informal future-oriented languages. As dialogue gives participants new ways to articulate and develop their thinking together, problems become easier to understand and resolve. »</span></p><p><span>To put it simply, at least part of what we're doing is building informal languages for thinking constructively about problems together.</span></p><p><span>That's already a bit long winded but I want to bring in another concern:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Maybe we want to spin off another project distinct from v4.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maybe we actually want to </span><strong><span>wind down</span></strong><span> work on the Handbook and switch to a different project.  Personally I'd rather keep the Handbook going but the idea of winding it down was raised at a recent meeting, partly on the basis that it's been four years since we made the last version... so at least we should check the feasibility of making a good v4.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The other factor is that our Futures paper uses </span><strong><span>ideas</span></strong><span> from Peeragogy but doesn't mention that term, so maybe this is a sign that we would be well positioned to spin off into something else.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>I'm sure there are some other perspectives on what's going on too, hence the heading here!

Yesterday I talked with my sister about why I have been doing what I've been doing for the last 20 years or so.  I made a comparison (maybe this seems overblown) to the civil rights movement.  Many people do not have the same educational privilege that I have had: I've had access to great teachers, great learning materials, and a few second chances.

We hope to make the peeragogy forum into a "practice space".

However, given that there's widespread confusion and some ruffled feathers on the topic of "advertising" and broader relationships between Peeragogy and other groups and activities, we might want to make something explicit about these topics in the Peeragogy Community Guidelines, which presently exist only in draft form: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bpFGRmtWVe8GoBKKH4wiuoM3uEBBDNfLzaYVzn20Ags/edit#heading=h.z8s7p3mq1dw0</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What did we learn or change?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>My asking Charles to write a PAR made him feel "put on the spot." That wasn't my intention: I genuinely wanted to recommend a practice that I enjoy. On reflection probably the links that Charles & Roland shared to CICOLab and MetaCAugs events are in the same basic genre of "sharing practices that I like." We could potentially approach all generically-labeled "sharing" through a more articulated language of "consent", keeping in mind these failure modes:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>If somebody serves non-consensually they’re being a martyr or rescuer.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If somebody takes non-consensually they’re being a perpetrator or groper.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If somebody allows non-consensually they’re being a doormat or pushover.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If somebody accepts non-consensually they’re being entitled and freeloading.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>— https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/sex/wheel-consent-im-fan/
How might that look here?  Well, at present I'm trying to "share" a (partially?) filled-in PAR rather than a "blank canvas".  This invites participation but doesn't require it.  I think Charlotte's suggestion, above, "How about a periodic short posting recapping the topics of interest to Peeragogy (which is almost all your content, TBH), and add a subscription link so people can opt-in?" runs on the same lines.  We've all "consented" to share some of our attention with others, but not necessarily to engage in others' preferred practices.  So, sharing thought-through and reasonably well-digested reflections rather than just invitations could help prevent people feeling "put on the spot."  We should also think about how we work together with more preliminary non-digested content...which in my experience is often one of the most fun parts of the peeragogy project!  But a topic for another day.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-else-should-we-change-going-forward?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What else should we change going forward?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Circumstantially: I want to move the Peeragogy forum to OSU Open Source Lab hosting soon. The initial purpose of my OSU OSL lab request was to be a one-for-one replacement for the Google Forum that makes it accessible to people who do not have a Google login, so I don't want to confuse matters by making it into something else in midstream. However, we might also want to think about making an "opt-in" moment sometime soon, so that we know that everyone who is on the forum actually wants to be there, and so that we get some of the other points of un-clarity cleared up. This could go along with introducing the "new" community guidelines.  To my mind, such opt-in moments have been a good part of our work in the past, and in light of the above comments about "consent" I think we should give these matters some attention!</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="30-september:-tl;dr-last-six-months"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>30 September: tl;dr last six months</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>For the tl/dr version of six months, peep this PAR, or Project Action Review[1].

learned that simply sending someone over to our website or discussion group
to explain peeragogy does not result in immediate understanding about the
project. A more welcoming interface is needed. We also learned that our
initial, emotional reactions to others’ expressed values or changes in process
seldom reflect reality of others’ intentions.
• Continue to evolve, listen, and pursue opportunities 
• Think in a sustainable way to make the group self-sufficient possibly by cre-
ating sellable products (books, articles, courses, etc.) so that the group can
have more than one website and raise our visibility.
• Create an accessible “dashboard” or graphical interface that will engage non-
technical people who can benefit from the patterns and best practices.
• Take participants’ well considered proposals at face value and imagine them
being successful before rejecting or opposing them.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="5"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>5</span></span></h2><section><p><span>N/A</span></p></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="draft-abstract"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Draft abstract</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="review-the-intention:-what-do-we-expect-to-learn-or-make-together?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>We propose using design patterns to engage with anticipatory learning and future studies.

Vaguely agreed on follow-up directions, this seems to be a general consensus, often with full agreement (e.g. on testing and making a collaborative Org Roam work, to further cement as tool for collective thinking in combination w/ individual)
David: there are ways I could help out with extra elisp, helping figure out a package, intro elisp workshop

BBB has some extra features? FSF controls.
You need to be a sponsor of FSF to use their Jitsi, but not sure if they support phone calls

Meeting w/ Jethro can be challenging (but worth it)
Leo, please follow up w/ JC about paper!
Meta-review of PARs later?
DOT+LV, looking at Peeragogy book
Allow up to 2 hours to discuss? — But we will put all the key things in 1st hour
Use David’s 1-to-1 as a template
Schedule further 1-to-1s for January?
