# ☞ Welcome to the Peeragogy Workbook!

This booklet is designed to introduce you to our fun, exciting world
of peer learning and peer production!!  You may already be familiar
with these terms, or they may be new to you. Either way, don't
worry!!!

If they are new, consider the following 2 examples.

1. *Peer learning*: Joe Corneli needs to get from the suburbs of
Chicago to the north side of the city.  He gets on the commuter train
and transfers to the purple “L” at Davis Street in Evanston. He plans
to change to the red line at Howard Street, but the train says “Loop”
and he asks another passenger whether it will stop at Howard. She says
it will, but that he can save an hour of his time by riding express to
the city and then coming back two stops!  Joe makes it to his meeting
with Charlie with plenty of time to spare.

2. *Peer production*: Two cavewomen see lightning strike a tree and
produce fire! Walking up to it they notice the heat and think
“Wouldn't it be nice to have fire for our family at night!” Once the
rain clears, they find some dry sticks and start working together to
figure out how they can use them to start their own flame. After hours
of trial and error, BOOM they've got fire!  The news travels fast. :)

Peeragogy is an approach to learning and working together on projects
ranging from the mundane to the monumental.  Peer learning and peer
production are probably as old as humanity itself, but they take on
new importance in the digital age.

The   Peeragogy   Project   is   an   informal   learning   project   with
members worldwide. Three members of the project share their
welcoming messages below.

**Paola Ricaurte Quijano**:  Welcome to the Peeragogy Project!
We are a group of enthusiastic people who love to learn and
are trying to find the best ways to learn together.

**Lisa Snow MacDonald**:   Welcome to peeragogy! It's kind of a
weird name, but it's enormously powerful in providing 
a fresh understanding of ways of working together. 

**Dorotea Mar**:  Your   contributions   will   be   really   welcome   if
you   participate   respectfully   and   harmoniously   with   other
peers.   It   can   change   your   life   and   improve   your   well­being
and make everything better.

# A Peeragogy Interview

## Introductions

**Paola Ricaurte Quijano**: Hi! I'm Paola, I'm from Ecuador. I work at
Tecnológico de Monterrey, a private university in Mexico City, and I
love to learn with everybody! 

**Dorotea Mar**: Hello.  I'm in Berlin now and I really like the
peeragogical atmosphere of collaboration and I think we are really
improving ways of collaboration and peer production, so that's why I'm
here.

**Lisa Snow MacDonald**: Hello. This is Lisa from Los Angeles. My
background is media psychology and I'm interested in peeragogy as it
relates to business.

*What is peer learning/production?*


**PRQ** Well, peer learning. learning with peers, learning from peers
and trying to make things together or make things happen together.  I
think that for me, the most important thing I've learned from this
experience is that you can achieve more when you work together and set
goals together.

<!--
**LSM** I think peer learning and peer production are unstructured ways
for people to come together to pool their relative strengths to
achieve results that might not be achieved if they were working
individually on their respective sections and then trying to assemble
them.

**DM** I'm still trying to find out.  i thought the answer to this
question was clear to me when I joined the Peeragogy Project and then
I realized there is so much more to this. When we're learning together
there are so many other processes happening and they are integral
processes of learning together. I think the answer is I'm still trying
to find out.

**PRQ** Yeah, I think Dorotea is right. I think that the process is the
goal. And the emotional relationships that you build during the
process are also important.
-->

**LSM** I think what peeragogy does is it allows us to recognize the
value of those connections. A lot of other ways of working are more
individualized. It goes back to a concept of 1 + 1 = 2, which is very
rational and very measured and is kind of a dominant way of thinking
in our society today, whereas peer to peer learning and production
recognize the value of those connections.  You may not be able to
measure it with a yardstick, but we understand that there is value in
those connections.  So it's basically acknowledging that when it comes
to learning/collaborative environments if constructed the right way if
working well it can be 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 = 4. That type of situation,
which is really different from the way we're used to thinking about
things. And I think that's really the value of what we're doing and
the potential of what we could hopefully unlock.

*More specifically, what is peeragogy and/or what is the Peeragogy Project?*

**PRQ** This is a project that began spontaneously. We didn't have a
plan at the beginning. We just talked about the things that concerned
us the most.  What do you need if you want to learn with others, how
to learn better? what do you want to learn? Where do you want to
learn? When do you want to learn? Basic questions that can be answered
in many ways.  We don't have a strict line. We have a map, maybe, but
a map that can be walked through by many different paths.
Paths that you choose can be related to the people you are working
with. I think it's been a great experience for us. As Lisa said, we
have been recognizing the talents and strengths of every person that
has contributed to and participated in this project.

**LSM** OK. I'll take my best shot with this. Going back to what I said
earlier and building off what other people have said.  Because we
don't have a good mental construct of how this
works, and measurement is difficult. We haven't learned how to measure
these connections. I think what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project
can do is it can establish what people have said about focusing on the
process. It can help people understand the process better.  Because
this lack of structure can be uncomfortable for people.  We need to
understand when that discomfort is acceptable, so they don't revert
and become counter­productive participants in the process. The map
analogy that Paola just mentioned, is really good too.  It's not about
providing a direct path. If you're on a trip trying to get from LA to
Chicago, there's many paths you can take.  It's making sure you're
monitoring your resources and you're taking care of things along the
way. You can drift off-course. One plus one can equal zero if things don't work
out well. So, what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project can do is
to provide some structure and framework around the unstructured way that
things can be done. People trying to make sure their methods are constructive
and beneficial now have some guidelines and things to watch out for.

## Example: Howard Rheingold Grows a Learning Network

“When I started using social media in the classroom, I looked for and began to learn from more experienced
educators.  First, I read and then tried to comment usefully on their
blog posts and tweets.  When I began to understand who knew what in
the world of social media in education, I narrowed my focus to the
most knowledgeable and adventurous among them.  I paid attention to
the people the savviest social media educators paid attention to. I
added and subtracted voices from my attention network, listened and
followed, then commented and opened conversations.  When I found
something I thought would interest the friends and strangers I was
learning from, I passed along my own learning through my blogs and
Twitter stream. I asked questions, asked for help, and eventually
started providing answers and assistance to those who seemed to know
less than I. The teachers I had been learning from had a name for what
I was doing — “growing a personal learning network.” So I started
looking for and learning from people who talked about HOW to grow a
“PLN” as the enthusiasts called them.”

***

<!--
**DM** For me peeragogy is really a great experience. I think the way
we do things we are going beyond any collaborative project
basically. We allow so much freedom/openness in the Project. Everyone
is welcome, basically.  Anyone can just jump in and propose something
and this will somehow fit in. And this is quite amazing for me. Over
the last year it will just be really creative.  We don't really have
any restrictions. People can join from anywhere in the world, like
today I was cooking and that was OK. So I think that's really nice,
the atmosphere, the relationships and the mutual respect we have for
each other and appreciation. This is really important.

**PRQ**    I think that when we began this we were thinking about a
new   pedagogy   of   learning   with   others,   so   that's   what
peeragogy   is,   a   new   way   of   seeing   and   collaborating   and
learning in open spaces and spaces that are not constrained
by time or space. It's an open learning environment for people
that   are   driven   by   self­motivation   of   going   somewhere   with
some others.
-->

*How do you do peeragogy?*

<!--
**LSM** That's a good question. I've been thinking more about how you
create a culture of peeragogy.  It can tend to be a natural extension
of the way in which people behave. If the culture/environment is
created around a group of people they will tend to participate in that
way. I'm not sure if you say I wanna do peeragogy I'm not sure how to
respond to that actually. Except I'd want a loose structure, I'm not
sure.
-->

**DM** I think I do a lot of peeragogy and I'm very happy about it
because I learn so much from my group and from myself in this group
that I like to apply it to other projects that I'm in or things like
co­working and co­living projects. Especially the
principle of mutual respect that still remains after a very long
time. And the way we relate to each other is really nice.

The main principle is mutual respect and openness, and the process. And in each
detail, there is value that we believe in.

Let's say how we manage the Peeragogy Page or Community (See “How to
Get Involved," later in this chapter.).  These seem to be details, but they're
actually really important. So if we pay attention to all these, every
little thing matters, and this is how I do it. I try to be very
mindful in all interactions.

## Example: Learner, know thyself.

When   he   joined   the   Peeragogy   project   in   2012,   Charles
Jeffrey Danoff did a brief self­evaluation about what makes
him interested in learning: 

1. Context. As a student, I resisted being groomed for some unforeseeable future. I'd rather work toward a specific goal.

2. Timing and sequence. I find learning fun when I’m studying
something as a way to procrastinate another pressing assignment.

3. Social reinforcement. Getting tips from peers on how to navigate a
snowboard around moguls was more fun for me than my Dad showing me the
proper way to buff the car’s leather seats on chore day.

4. Experiential awareness. In high school, it was not fun to sit and
compose a 30-page reading journal on Frankenstein. But owing in part
to those types of prior experiences, I now find writing pleasurable
and it’s fun to learn how to write better.

***

**PRQ** I think peeragogy is more like a mind­set. I think we have to
change the way we interact with others and the way we understand the
parameters of learning. For example, I'm a teacher and, of course,
my teaching practice promotes collaborative, creative
learning. So, I expect my students to take responsibility for their own learning
by making decisions about most aspects of the learning process; to program their own learning goals. They need to learn to effectively employ the environments (like whiteboards), the activities, and the assessments. I'm trying
to give my learners the tools to decide how, what, and why they
want to learn. For me, it's been a very interesting experience. Learners often find it unfamiliar to make their own
decisions about the process in a formal environment. At the beginning
of the semester, students are given everything and usually just follow
guidelines and criteria. I have been trying to change this dynamic. Students feel insecure, because they
really do not know how or what they want to do. So, that process of
making decisions together becomes very rich and very meaningful.

<!--
**DM** This, for us, was like a workshop so that we also learn how to be
more peeragogical, and I think we're extending it to all the domains
of our life. It's almost like we are
coaching each other in being more collaborative. This is a
very good thing for us, as well.

**PRQ** As Lisa said, we are developing this culture of collaboration in different environments and seeing each environment as an opportunity to learn together.

**DM** I think we're also spreading a culture of collaboration and that is a beautiful experience. This is an
ongoing experience. We help others to experience this by interacting on project processes and outcomes. 

The whole process of learning together was also a
learning process. It helped us to create
a culture of collaboration and we have transferred
it to other groups we interact with. 

**LSM** I think what Dorotea said is important, because we often don't
have the right language and many words have double meanings. So when
we look at the concept of a team, it can carry with it different
meanings. One can be disjointed approach where everyone has specific,
different roles or there are other concepts of team where everyone is
integrated and working together. And yet a lot of times those
differences aren't communicated directly when you're working with
groups. So we're bringing to the surface things that are often
implicit when they're working in groups and by pulling it to the
surface we're raising awareness that people are making choices and
there are these different choices in how we approach things. 

Where do you do peeragogy?

**DM** Everywhere I can. Even in the kitchen, cooking with a
friend, I am doing peeragogy.

**LSM** I think you can do it just about anywhere. My interest though
is as it relates to business. How different groups and departments
work together.

**PRQ** I agree with Dorotea. I try to "peeragogy" everywhere. We should create 
a verb for that! I collaborate w/a group of human rights activists in 
Contingentemx (http://contingentemx.net/) and I also see my
interactions there as a peeragogical practice. When you are in a
family you should understand you are a team, and if you see
every member as a valuable contributor to the common goals of that
team, it works much better.
-->

***

## Example: Metacognition and Mindfulness

> Alan Schoenfeld: “What (exactly) are you doing? Can you describe it
precisely?  Why are you doing it?  How does it fit into the solution?
How does it help you?  What will you do with the outcome when you
obtain it? ” [1]

***

*When do you do peeragogy?*

**DM** I think I'm always practicing it. I really like that during the weekly hangouts we don't
usually have rigid agendas. We just get creative and let ideas connect and flow.
And whatever happens it's the right thing. We just work
together and somehow the right things happen. I think we're always
doing peeragogy when we pursue activities and projects in open, collaborative ways without imposing too much structure or heirarchy.

**PRQ** I agree with Dorotea. The where and when questions
are related. If you're thinking about where, you're thinking about
when. So if "where" is everywhere, and "when" is always, 
I agree. Anywhere, everywhere, all the time. It's an ongoing
process. If you believe in peeragogy as a way of doing things or making things happen, you cannot switch back and forth betweeen two different personas and say, "I'm not working with
peeragogy now," or "I am applying peeragogy now."

**LSM** I'm familiar with the business world where there are distinct personalities. For example there are people who tend to be more collaborative just by nature, who tend to adapt and to prefer a peeragogical model.  Other personalities are less so, and that's why what we're doing here is valuable. In practice, there's seldom a conscious recognition of these different styles of working. In a business environment, there are different motivators, different personalities tossed together, all united by a single goal.  So understanding peeragogical vs. heirarchical practices, and raising the differences to the surface, could be very valuable in pursuing the goal of making people's lives better in the business environment.

<!--
**DM** To pick up on what Paola said about the process.  Sometimes we
like to imagine that Peeragogy is just that, a simple process, but then we
realize that it's actually something more.
It means more and more each time we refer to
it. It's an evolving process, a continually evolving construct. The more we practice it, the better we
understand it and the broader we view the entire landscape around it.
What really matters is how we practice this process. Our learning and increasing understanding of what it really is are both part of the process itself.   It is a notion that evolves through our exploration of it. 

**PRQ** Yeah, I agree with Dorotea in the sense that it's a dynamic,
on­going process.  It's very important to be aware of the metacognition
involved. We are always reflecting on just what we are doing and how we are going about it.
How do we want do this? What do we want?  Why? Are we doing the right
thing? It's a long process as we're always asking ourselves
questions but that is just part of the learning
process. As a result, we become increasingly aware of just what should be promoted
and what might be better left alone.  Who does peeragogy?

**PRQ** Of course, we consider ourselves to be a peeragogy team. Not
everybody is familiar with our, let's say, strategies and beliefs. If we are thinking, feeling, creating ways to solve problems peeragogically, then this is a useful structure to apply to a variety of environments.
It becomes difficult when others try to impose rules or define things without considering our
ideas or input. Lisa was talking about organizations. Peeragological principles, applied to entrepreneurial environments/contexts could be highly effective in increasing the power of the given missions. 

**LSM** I think a lot of people working in business environments are unaware of the peeragogical principles they use daily.
 I think we all are to some extent. Digital activities like surfing around
 social media, googling, or going into
chatrooms can be a kind of peeragogy (of peer to peer to peer support):
a way of solving a particular problem.  I think everybody does it
on different levels, but they may not be aware of it.
-->

**DM** There are many collaborative projects that aim to do something
similar to this, but, in a sense, focus on different aspects of the process, and maybe not on such an abstract level as we might. 

Some people have natural peeragogical tendencies, and some people are less
transparent in the way they do things. For me, peeragogy is really
beneficial, especially for collaborative projects. Everybody works and learns differently, so if everyone became increasingly aware of how they and others work and learn, of how peergogy functions, and how it all fits into a bigger picture, many tasks would not only be more efficiently done, but also much more enjoyable. It's also beneficial if everyone focusses on a bigger picture instead of focussing only on their part of it, and if attention is drawn to all that could be done in a peeragogical way. 


***

## Example: Jay Cross on Setting Sail

“If I were an instructional designer in a moribund
training department, I’d polish up my resume and head over
to marketing. Co­learning can differentiate services, increase
product   usage,   strengthen   customer   relationships,   and
reduce   the   cost   of   hand­holding.   It’s   cheaper   and   more
useful than advertising. But instead of just making a copy of
today’s boring educational practices, build something based
on interaction and camaraderie, perhaps with some healthy
competition thrown in. Again, the emphasis should always be
on learning in order to do something!” 


***


*Why do you do peeragogy?*

<!--
**DM**       Because it feels really nice. It helps a lot with relating to
others and evolving the relationships we share in projects and, well, 
basically everywhere. It's a very healthy way of doing things
and it makes us feel good, makes others feel good. I think it's a
good thing in general.
-->

**PRQ**    Why? Well, as said before, I believe in peeragogy. I believe
it's a good way to learn. Maybe it's the best way. 
I think I wasn't aware of that before joining the group. I have
always been a self­learner, I have been working mostly alone.
After I began working with the group, I understood that you
grow working with a group. 
You achieve things that you aren't able to achieve alone. I think
there's a growing awareness of the value of collaboration in every
setting and environment.  There are more and more learning communities
around the world where people are also learning that making decisions 
together and working together are the best way
to be in this world! I think as we live through hard times, we 
increasingly need a sense that we are not alone and that we
cannot solve problems alone.

<!--
**LSM**       My interest in peeragogy goes back to an experience in
business where I saw the potential benefits of peeragogy in an organization
being   stripped   away   as   new executives  (who didn't   understand   what   they   were
stripping away) came   in. I enjoy it, I see the benefits because I've experienced it and I've
seen how corrosive other ways of thinking can be to the well
being of both employees and corporations.
-->
 
*How did you join the Peeragogy project?*

**PRQ** After taking Howard Rheingold's course on Mind Amplifiers 
in 2012 we were invited to join this group. There was no plan, 
just an open question of how to best learn with others.  
That's how it began.  We had lots of sessions and discussed a wide 
range of issues.  The Peeragogy Handbook (http://peeragogy.org) 
was the product of that process.  We've been working with the Handbook, 
releasing a new version every year and trying to figure out what might
be the best way to go forward and what the future of our collaboration
as a group/team might be. 

**LSM** A couple friends of mine were involved in P2P learning.  They
were invited to a conference at UCI. Howard was at the event and they
were familiar with him and his work.  We ended up in an obscure 
classroom and he started talking about principles that were peeragogy 
related, while I don't know if it provided much value to my friends, 
it sounded a lot like what I saw in business and he mentioned the group. 
So after that, I met everyone here and it's been pretty random.

**DM** I think many paths led to my involvement.  I have a lot of academic 
experience and was doing research on Open Science. I had always
wanted to improve the way things work and somehow I wanted to do it
more creatively.  I resonated a lot with the Peeragogy Project on many 
levels, so somehow I just joined, I think it was serendipity of some kind.

This interview was conducted on December 15th, 2014. The transcript
was edited. You can watch the whole interview online at

We've given you some examples but this wouldn't
be a proper workbook without an exercise.
