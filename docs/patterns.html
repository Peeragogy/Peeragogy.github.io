  projects, Peeragogy, at its core, comes to life in applied practice.
  Even before convening a group for your peer learning project
  (discussed in </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.github.io/convening.html" target="_blank">Part IV</a><span>),
  you will want to take a look over the patterns we have collected. You
  will likely return here many times as your project develops.</span></p></blockquote></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="what-is-a-pattern?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What is a pattern?</span></span></h2><section><p><span>A pattern is anything that has a repeated effect. In the context of
peeragogy, the practice is to repeat processes and interactions that
advance the learning mission. Frequent occurrences that are not
desirable are called anti-patterns!</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Christopher Alexander</span></strong><span>: "Each pattern describes a problem which
  occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the
  core of the solution to that problem, in a way that you can use this
  solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way
  twice." [1]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Patterns provide a framework that can be applied to similar issues but
may be metaphorically solved in different ways, sometimes in real world
or face to face events and other times in digital space.  Outside of
Alexander's own work in architecture, one the first groups to adopt a
design pattern way of thinking about things were computer programmers. 
Writing in the foreward to Richard P. Gabriel's </span><em><span>Patterns of Software</span></em><span>,
Alexander emphasizes that the key question to ask about any design
approach is: does it help us build better?</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Christopher Alexander</span></strong><span>: "What is the Chartres of programming? What
  task is at a high enough level to inspire people writing programs, to
  reach for the stars?" [2]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>We think that Peeragogy stands a good chance of being a "killer app" for
pattern-based design.  Learning bridges physical and virtual worlds all
the time.  And, in fact, a </span><em><span>Network of Learning</span></em><span> was the 18th pattern
that Christopher Alexander introduced in his book, </span><em><span>A Pattern Language</span></em><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Christopher Alexander</span></strong><span>: "Work in piecemeal ways to decentralize the
  process of learning and enrich it through contact with many places and
  people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home or walking
  through the city, professionals willing to take on the young as
  helpers, older children teaching younger children, museums, youth
  groups travelling, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old
  people, and so on." [1]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Peeragogy can help to extend and enrich this network, and, as we shall
see, patterns can be used by those involved to do ongoing "emergent"
design, not only by building new structures, but by adapting and
improving our catalog of patterns as we go.  For consistency, and easy
use, adaptation, and extension we present the patterns using the
following template.  The format is meant to be neutral and easy to work
with -- it's, intentionally, an outline that you might use to write a
short abstract describing an active project.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Title</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Encapsulate the idea - possibly include a subtitle</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Context</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Describe the context in which it is meaningful. What are
  the key </span><strong><span>forces</span></strong><span> acting in this context?</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Problem</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Explain why there's some issue to address here.</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Solution</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Talk about an idea about how to address the issue.</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Rationale</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Why do we use this solution as opposed to some other
  solution?</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Resolution</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>How are the key forces resolved when the solution is
  applied?</span></em></p><p><span>  </span><strong><span>What's Next</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Talk about specific next steps. How will the active
  forces continue to resolve in our project?</span></em></p><p><span>  Patterns include the following optional elements:</span></p><p><span>  [*Examples*: /Present example(s) that have been encountered, if this
  aids comprehension./]</span></p><p><span>  [*References*: /Citations, if relevant./]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The "What's Next" section concretely links the patterns we discuss here
to the Peeragogy project. It can be thought of as an annotation rather
than part of the pattern itself. If you adapt the patterns for use in
your own project, you're likely to have a different set of next steps.
Although we think that these patterns can be generally useful, they
aren't useful in the abstract, but rather, as a way for discussing what
we actually do.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="a-peeragogy-pattern-language"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A peeragogy pattern language</span></span></h2><section><p><span>By looking at how patterns combine in real and hypothetical use cases,
you can start to identify a </span><em><span>pattern language</span></em><span> that can be used in your
projects. We can get a simplified view of these connections with the
following diagram.  It's important to clarify that everyone doesn't do
it the same way.  Here, the </span><em><span>Roadmap</span></em><span> is given a central position, but
some peer learning projects will forego making a specific, detailed
plan; their plan is just to see what develops. You can see here how
peeragogy patterns often break down further into individual micro-steps:
we'll say more about that shortly.</span></p><p><img src="/images/pattern-language.jpg" /><span> [can this chart be larger? Looks
very small in text] The subsequent main sections of this book --</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/convene/" target="_blank">/Convene/</a><span>,</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/organize/" target="_blank">/Organize/</a><span>,</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/facilitate/" target="_blank">/Cooperate/</a><span> and</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/assessment/" target="_blank">/Assess/</a><span> (for short) -- represent
big clusters of patterns that are likely to come up time and again in
various projects.  We can think of these as East, South, West, and North
in the diagram above. You are encouraged to invent your own patterns and
to connect them in new ways. You'll probably find quite a few that we
didn't include in the catalog. Each project has a unique design, and
it's own unique way in which things play out in practice. What we've put
together here is a starter kit. The peeragogy patterns suggest a social
way to do problem solving [3], but once you get used to the pattern
concept you can use it to identify new problems no one has ever thought
of before, and that's even more powerful!</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="references"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>References</span></span></h3><section><ol><li><p><span>Alexander, C., Ishikawa, S., and Silverstein, M.
