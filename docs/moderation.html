  de-personalize the issue and reduce the stress level, making people's

impossible (and would be undesirable) for any one person to moderate all
of them. The difficulty occurs if one of these conversations becomes
uncomfortable for one or more participants, for whatever reason. Rather
than depending on one central moderator, it's useful for everyone in the
project to be aware of the principles underlying effective moderation,
and apply them together even in small side-projects.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what&apos;s-next:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What's Next:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We recently ran a Paragogical Action Review to elicit feedback from
