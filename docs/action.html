  out the question. [1]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Welcome to the Peeragogy Handbook! We want to kick things off with a
candid confession: we're not going to pretend that this book is perfect.
In fact, it's not an ordinary book at all. The adventure starts when you
get out your pen or pencil, or mouse and keyboard, and begin marking it
up. It gets kicked into high gear when you join Peeragogy in Action.
You'll find a lot of friendly support as you write, draw, or dance your
own peeragogical adventure. But first, what is peeragogy?</span></p><p><span>Peeragogy is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and
peer knowledge production. Whereas pedagogy deals with the transmission
of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy is what people use to
produce and apply knowledge together. The strength of peeragogy is its
flexibility and scalability. The learning mind-set and strategies that
we are uncovering in the Peeragogy project can be applied in classrooms,
hackerspaces, organizations, wikis, and interconnected collaborations
across an entire society.</span></p><p><span>The Peeragogy Handbook is a compendium of know how for any group of
people who want to co-learn any subject together, when none of them is
an expert in the particular subject matter -- learning together without
one traditional teacher, especially using the tools and knowledge
available online. What we say in the Handbook draws extensively on our
experiences working together on the Handbook -- and our experiences in
other collaborative projects that drew us here in the first place. The
best way to learn about peeragogy is to do peeragogy, not just read
about it. Towards that end, coauthors and fans of the Handbook have an
active Google+ community, conveniently called Peeragogy in Action. We
maintain a regular schedule of weekly meetings that you're welcome to
join. The Handbook includes a short syllabus, which also called
"Peeragogy in Action", and you can work through this with your own group
as you read through the book.</span></p><p><span>You're warmly invited to combine your local projects with the global
effort, and get involved in making the next edition of the Handbook.
That doesn't necessarily require you to do extensive writing or editing.
We're always interested in new use cases, tricky problems, and
interesting questions. In fact, our view is that any question is a good
question.</span></p><p><span>Here are some of the ways in which the current edition of the Handbook
is not perfect. You're welcome to add to the list! These are places
where you can jump in and get involved. This list gives a sense of the
challenges that we face putting peeragogy into action.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="scrapbook-of-peeragogical-problems"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Scrapbook of Peeragogical Problems</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="maintaining-a-list-of-useful-resources"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Maintaining a list of useful resources</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We include references and recommended reading in the Handbook, and there
are a lot more links that have been shared in the Peeragogy in Action
community. It's a ongoing task to catalog and improve these resources --
including books, videos, images, projects, technology, etc. In short,
let's "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"! As a good start, Charlotte Pierce has
been maintaining a spreadsheet under the heading "survey" in our Google
Drive.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="developing-a-really-accessible-diy-tool-kit"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Developing a really accessible DIY tool-kit</span></span></h3><section><p><span>A short "workbook" containing interviews and some activities follows
this introduction, but it could be much more interactive. Amanda Lyons
and Paola Ricaurte made several new exercises and drawings that we could
include. A more developed workbook could be split off from the handbook
into a separate publication. It would be great to have something simple
for onramping. For example, the workbook could be accompanied by video
tutorials for new contributors.</span></p><p><span>Paola Ricaurte points out that a really useful book will be easy to
sell. For teachers interested in peeragogy, this needs to be something
that can be use in workshops or on their own, to write in, to think
through issues. We're partway there, but to improve things, we really
need a better set of activities.</span></p><p><span>The next time Paola or someone else uses the handbook or workbook to run
a workshop, she can say, "turn to this page, let's answer this question,
you have 10 minutes." There are lots of places where the writing in the
handbook could be made more interactive. One technique Paola and Amanda
used was turning "statements" from the handbook into "questions."</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="crafting-a-visual-identity"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Crafting a visual identity</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Amanda also put together the latest cover art, with some collaboration
from Charlotte using inDesign. A more large-scale visual design would be
a good goal for the 4th Edition of the book. Fabrizio Terzi, who made
the handbook cover art for the 1st Edition, has been working on making
our website more friendly. So, again, work is in progress but we could
use your help.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="workflow-for-the-4th-edition"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Workflow for the 4th edition</span></span></h3><section><p><span>We've uploaded the content of the book to Github and are editing the
"live" version of the site in Markdown. For this and previous print
editions, we've converted to LaTeX. There are a number of workflow
bottlenecks: First, people need to be comfortable updating the content
on the site. Second, it would be good to have more people involved with
the technical editing work that goes into compiling for print. Remember,
when we produce an actual physical handbook, we can sell it. In fact,
because all co-authors have transferred their copyright in this book to
the Public Domain, anyone can print and sell copies, convert the
material into new interactive forms, or do just about anything with it.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="translations"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Translations</span></span></h3><section><p><span>Translating a book that's continually being revised is pretty much a
nightmare. With due respect to the valiant volunteer efforts that have
been attempted so far, it might be more convenient for everyone involved
to just pay professional translators or find a way to foster a
multi-lingual authoring community, or find a way to create a more robust
process of collective translation. Ideas are welcome, and we're making
some small steps here. More on this below.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="next-steps?-what&apos;s-the-future-of-the-project?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Next steps? What's the future of the project?</span></span></h3><section><p><span>In short: If we make the Handbook even more useful, then it will be no
problem to sell more copies of it. That is one way to make money to
cover future expenses. It's a paradigmatic example for other business
models we might use in the future. But even more important than a
business model is a sense of our shared vision, which is why we're
working on a "Peeragogy Creed" (after the Taekwondo creed, which exists
in various forms, one example is [2]). No doubt you'll find the first
version on peeragogy.org soon! Chapter 7 contains a further list of
practical next steps for the project.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="references"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>References</span></span></h3><section><ol><li><p><span>Joshua Schimel, 2012.

the global demand for learning opportunities. Our primary textbook will
be the Peeragogy Handbook (currently in a 3rd edition). This text may be
of particular interest to students in the Department of Education and
the Institute for Global Leadership, however, the accompanying readings
are fundamentally interdisciplinary, and anyone from any discipline is
welcome. Participants will contribute to critical review, expository
writing, media production, and creative design. One outcome will be a
collaboratively produced Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) based on the
course materials. We will design and develop additional innovative
interventions. Peer learning will be practiced throughout, by tailoring
the syllabus, developing new ways of processing and presenting the
course material, through supportive peer feedback, and in collaborative
final projects.</span></p><p><span>Contact time each week will be divided into a recitation, a practicum,
and an open studio.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Recitation will be 1 hour with two seminar-style presentations led by
   students, synthesizing a collection of papers or summarizing a book.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Practicum will be a 1 hour long workshop-style interaction where we
   discuss that week's material and the next steps in the associated
   research.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Open studio will be 1 hour of time each week to work collaboratively
   on projects, and will include guest lectures and other smaller group
   activities.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Our strategy will be to use the Handbook as our primary read/write
knowledge base, and to draw on other relevant texts to build a shared
language. In order to cover a wide range of material, it is not
necessary or expected for every student to read every text, but
presentation is required for a passing grade. One of our aims is to
learn how to do more as a team than we could accomplish as a loose group
of individuals. Discussions will be recorded and shared online to
broaden access and engage a wider public. The readings will be
frontloaded: the last four weeks of the course will be devoted to the
design and prototyping of new interventions that can be developed
further after the course.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="learning-outcomes"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Learning outcomes</span></span></h2><section><p><span>By the end of the course, students will be able to synthesize
interventions relevant to global economic challenges. They will gain
design and media production skills relevant to creating a Massive Open
Online Course. It is expected that students will also train the
affective dimensions of their engagement with difficult issues, by
practicing rigorous self-assessment and developing constructive feedback
for their peers. Specifically, students successfully completing the
course will build a portfolio of evidence that they can receive major
challenges with compassion, respond with an awareness of diverse needs,
value others' perspectives and voices, organize effective networks and
strategies, and characterize constructive collaborative efforts and ways
to support them.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="agenda"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Agenda</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Wk 1: Introduction (Joe) :: Develop a collective intention. The course
  will involve a lot of thinking about co-design and we will start by
  co-designing the experience we will have together. We will update this
  Agenda or "Roadmap" as we work together. We will introduce and
  distribute Rheingoldian "roles" for our co-learning as well as
  editorial roles needed for co-producing the next edition of the
  Peeragogy Handbook, and an Action Review template.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 2. :: A deeper dive into co-learning. Reading and even
  regurgitating is fairly passive. So, to learn more, students can
  devise more interesting ways to share the material they are engaging
  with. Each student will focus on developing expertise in one or two
  specific learning areas (i.e. digital comments, peer production,
  volunteer mobilization.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 3 :: Gain experience with agile project management. We will adapt
  the Handbook's Pattern Catalogue and maintain a record of 'next steps'
  to feed back into our local project(s).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 4 :: Develop a networking strategy: Who else should we involve in
  our learning? We will start reaching out to other people to co-design
  final outcomes for the class. We will review the "Data Fair" from Data
  Science for Design as one way to organize such outreach, and discuss
  which methods will work best for us. For example, students may
  experiment with uploading text to Wikipedia and engage in discussions
  there.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 5 :: Develop and discuss research designs. What questions will we
  be addressing? What problems will we be solving? What problems will we
  not be solving? What are appropriate research methods?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 6 :: Gain experience with dialogue-facilitation strategies. How do
  the approaches to peer learning that we have been studying so far in
  the course relate to each other? E.g., imagine a conversation between
  Benkler and Alexander, or Ostrom and Batchelor: would they agree about
  anything? Disagree? We will explore different facilitation strategies
  to strategically prepare for the design phase in the final weeks of
  the course, asking "What would be a good design for peer learning in
  your planned intervention?"</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 7 :: Understand technologies used in peer production and
  small-scale collaborations. What additional tools and literacies will
  we need to "contribute back" during the rest of the course? What
  technologies do the projects that we are developing need in order to
  work optimally? Do these tools exist? What would do we need to learn
  or develop to bring them into existence, or to use existing tools
  well?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 8 :: Discuss the relationship between learning and social
  movements. How can we contextualise the Peeragogy project relative to
  other initiatives? Does the project itself have "peers" that it can
  learn from?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Wk 9 :: Put peeragogy within its social and historical context. What
  does the past, present, and future of learning look like? What role
  does peeragogy play in economic development and sustainability?</span></p></li></ul><p><span>(Weeks 1-9 are paired with readings in the Peeragogy Handbook and
Readings from the list below.)</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="ideas-for-final-collaborative-projects"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Ideas for final collaborative projects</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Some questions that end-of-term projects might address include the
following:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Quantitative trends can be easily analysed, but how do we measure,
  e.g., whether our design patterns are actually useful? Does using the
  patterns produce a qualitative change in the group; e.g., do they lead
  to a feeling of happiness for participants? Can we understand and
  revise our thinking about collaboration using Christopher Alexander's
  fifteen principles from the Nature of Order?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Are we successfully inventing new ways of relating that address the
  needs of people with limited access to educational opportunity? What
  does the global need look like? What inventions and interventions are
  out there now? What's missing?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we extract re-usable patterns from the literature on MOOCS,
  crowdfunding and other collaborative or collective projects? What are
  the best ways we can "scale up" the Peeragogy project and this course?
  And/or, how would we make peeragogy a more effective practical
  approach for projects at the local scale?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can we develop our strategy for translating our learning within the
  Peeragogy project to (and from) diverse audiences? Who else should we
  be talking to? What other projects are doing similar things?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Borrowing a technique from religious studies, we can ask: how does
  Peeragogy differ from other related approaches? Is the world ready for
  a global peer learning movement? What can peer learning contribute to
  ongoing peer production efforts and vice versa?</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="assessment"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Assessment</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Students should consider the list of intended Learning Outcomes in this

peeragogues, or first-timers. The guide should be useful for groups who
want to build a strong collaboration, as well as to facilitators or
theorists who want to hone their practice or approach. Together, we will
use our various talents to build effective methods and models for peer
produced peer learning. We've labeled the phases as Stage 1 through

important roles in the Peeragogy project was the role of the 'Wrapper',
who prepared and circulated weekly summaries of forum activity. This
helped people stay informed about what was happening in the project even
if they didn't have time to read the forums. We've also found that small
groups of people who arrange their own meetings are often the most
productive.</span></p><p><em><span>Further Reading</span></em><span> -- Argyris, Chris. "Teaching smart people how to

over 3700 comments in our discussion forum, and over 200 pages of
expository text in the handbook. It has given contributors a new way of
thinking about things together. However, the project has not had the
levels of engagement that should be possible, given the technology
available, the global interest in improving education, and the number of
thoughful participants who expressed interest. We hope that the handbook
and this accompanying syllabus will provide a seed for a new phase of
learning, with many new contributors and new ideas drawn from real-life
applications.</span></p><p><span>We began with these four questions:</span></p><ol><li><p><em><span>How does a motivated group of self-learners choose a subject or
   skill to learn?</span></em></p></li><li><p><em><span>How can this group identify and select the best learning resources

We've
begun a series of weekly Hangouts on Air that have brought in many
additional discussants, all key people who can help to fulfil
peeragogy's promise. The handbook has been considerably improved through
edits and discussion. The next step for us is putting this work into
action in the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Accelerator</span></em><span>.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="micro-case-study:-the-peeragogy-project,-year-3"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Micro-Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 3</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We published our plans as "Building the Peeragogy Accelerator",
presenting it at OER14 and inviting feedback. In the run up to this, we
had been very active creating additional abstracts and submitting them
to conferences. However, despite our efforts we failed to recruit any
newcomers for the trial run of the Accelerator. Even so, piloting the
Accelerator with some of our own projects worked reasonably well,</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#1" id="fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a><span>
but we decided to focus on the handbook in the second half of the year.
As the project's line-up shifted, participants reaffirmed the importance
of having "no camp counsellors." In the last quarter of 2014, we created
the workbook that is now presented in Part I, as a quickstart guide to
peeragogy. We also revised the pattern catalog, and used the revised
format to create a "distributed roadmap" for the Peeragogy project --
featured in Chapter 7 of the third edition of the handbook.</span></p><span class="firn-footnote-def"><span id="1" style="padding-right: 8px">1</span><span><p><span> For an overview, see </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://is.gd/up_peeragogy_accelerator" target="_blank"></a><span>.</span></p></span><a href="#fn-1" style="padding-left: 4px">↩</a></span></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
