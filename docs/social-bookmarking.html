Johnson, April 10, 1:59pm PDT</span></p><p><strong><span>What is Social Bookmarking?</span></strong></p><p><strong><em><span>Social bookmarking</span></em></strong><span> lets you share online links and resources among
many other people, both publicly and in closed groups. Bookmarks are
stored and shared "in the cloud," tagged or labeled with commons or
unique sets of labels for group use.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="possible-features:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Possible Features:</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><strong><span>Easy Add-Ons:</span></strong><span> Users can install a bookmarklet or browser add-on that
  enables them to select a snippet of text from any web page and/or
  write their own brief description of that web page, add appropriate
  tags, and save the bookmark in a way that makes it available to
  others.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Searchable:</span></strong><span> Users can find bookmarks by going through collections of
  bookmarks, searching through tags, or browsing their (or their
  group's) library of bookmarks.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>URLs or Blogrolls for Collections:</span></strong><span> Some social bookmarking services
  make it possible to send others a unique URL for an entire
  </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://delicious.com/hrheingold/socialbookmarking" target="_blank">collection
  of bookmarks</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Public/Private:</span></strong><span> Some services make it possible to create public or
  private groups; whenever one person bookmarks a resource, it becomes
  visible to all group members in the group library.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Email Digests:</span></strong><span> Group members can opt to receive daily or weekly
  emails with all the bookmarks & snippets from members of that group.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Highlighting/Annotation:</span></strong><span> Some services (i.e.,
  </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://www.diigo.com/" target="_blank">Diigo</a><span>)
  enable individuals to highlight specific passages of text and create
  unique URLs they can share with others that display that web page with
  their highlighted passages; other members of a Diigo group can add
  "sticky note" comments to pages, attached to specific highlighted
  passages, and comment on the comments.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Themes or Groupings:</span></strong><span> Some services (i.e.,
  </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a><span>)
  enable users to create collections of thematically-related bookmarks
  with several tags ("Stacks") and share them. Some services (i.e.

  particular topic, and agree upon a set of tags.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Using a group or team feature, individual members of a peeragogy group
  can add bookmarks that are available in various ways to other members
  of the group.</span></p></li><li><p><span>This kind of service can be particularly useful when gathering
  resources as candidates for a self-organized syllabus --- services
  that enable discussions of particular texts can help member of a group
  decide how to qualify and prioritize resources.</span></p></li></ul></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="things-to-keep-in-mind"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Things to keep in mind</span></span></h2><section><ul><li><p><span>Does the service enable groups or teams?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can groups be private?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Can individuals and groups highlight passages, leave notes attached to
