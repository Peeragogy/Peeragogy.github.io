#### Definition:

Meaning-carrying tools, like handbooks or maps, can help people use an
idea, collecting content and stories.

#### Problem:

When the idea or system is only “newly discovered”, the associated
meanings may not be well understood, and indeed they may not have been
created. Even if a topic is only “personally new”, it can be hard to
find ones way around.

#### Solution:

In such a case, the process of creating the guide can go hand-in-hand
with figuring out how the system works. Thus, techniques of [knowledge
cartography](http://knowledgecartography.org/) and [meaning
making](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-47/two.html)
are useful for would-be guide creators.

#### Example:

We started the Peeragogy project by collaboratively making an outline
for the Peeragogy Handbook. We recommended this handbook-making practice
to others, as a way to learn collaboratively and build a strong group.

#### Challenges:

Remember that “the map is not the territory,” and map-making is only one
facet of shared human activity. For instance, a pattern description can
be thought of as a “micro-map” of a specific activity. These maps are
not useful if they are divorced from practice.

#### What’s Next:

We’ve been talking with collaborators in the Commons Abundance Network
about how to make a Pattern Language for the Commons. One of the
challenges that arises is how to support ongoing development of the
Pattern Language itself: a “living” map for a living territory. We’re
refining the Peeragogy Pattern language and template as a seed for this.
