people on four continents who had not met and had not known about each
other before we began meeting online. The process involves asynchronous
media, including forums, wikis, social bookmarking groups, and
Wordpress, but it probably would never have cohered into a group capable
of collective action if it had not been for the real-time meetings where
we were able to see each other's faces, hear each other's voices, use a
whiteboard as an anonymous agenda-generator, exchange links in chat,
show each other examples through screen-sharing. Together, the
asynchronous and real-time media enabled us to begin to see ourselves as
an effective group. We used both real-time and asynchronous tools to
work out processes for creating, refining, and publishing the Handbook,
to divide labor, decide on platforms and processes, to collaboratively
compose and edit articles, and to design and add graphical and video
elements. In particular, we used the</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx" target="_blank">Blackboard
Collaborate</a><span> platform, a web-service that enables up to 50 people at a
time to meet in a multimedia, recordable, meeting room for around
$500/year. We've experimented with other paid platforms, such as</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://success.adobe.com/en/na/sem/products/connect/1109_6011_connect_webinars.html" target="_blank">Adobe
Connect</a><span> (about the same price as Collaborate), and when we meet in
groups of ten or less, we often use the free and recordable</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google+ Hangout</a><span>
service. Smaller groups also use </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a><span> or free
telephone conferencing
services.  </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Mumble</a><span> is an open source
audio-only tool that is popular with gamers. We're watching the
development of </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.bigbluebutton.org/" target="_blank">Big Blue Button</a><span>, a
free and open-source real-time meeting platform, as it develops the full
suite of tools that are currently only available for a fee. Dozens of
other free, ad-supported and/or freemium webconferencing systems such as</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.bigmarker.com/about" target="_blank">Big Marker</a><span> and</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.dimdim.com" target="_blank">Dim-Dim</a><span> can be found in lists like</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://delicious.com/hrheingold/webconferencing" target="_blank">Howard Rheingold's</a><span>

services provide another technological "lowest common denominator": some
provide a few extras like downloadable recordings.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="features-of-real-time-meeting-platforms"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Features of real-time meeting platforms</span></span></h1><section><p><span>There are many free services for chat, screen-sharing, whiteboards, and
video conferencing, but combining all these components in separate panes
of the same screen (preferably) or as separate tabs of a browser can
have a powerful synchronizing and harmonizing effect on the group. The
features to look for in meeting platforms include:</span></p><p><strong><span>Audio and video</span></strong><span>: Choose platforms that enable
voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) and easy ways for participants to
configure their microphones and speakers. Today's webcams, together with
adequate lighting and a broadband connection, enable a number of people
to be visible at the same time. In Blackboard Collaborate, the person
who is speaking at a given moment is visible in the largest video pane,
while other participants are available in smaller video windows. Audio
and video convey much more of a human dimension than text communications
alone. A group of people who have seen and heard each other online are
able to work together via asynchronous media such as forums and wikis
more effectively. Online face-to-face meetings are often the best way
for a group to argue constructively and decide on critical issues.
Forums and email are comparatively bad choices for distributed
decison-making.</span></p><p><strong><span>Slide pushing:</span></strong><span> The best platforms will convert .ppt or .pdf files for
sequential display. With the addition of text chat, annotations to
slides, and the ability to "raise your hand" or interrupt with your
voice, an online lecture can be a more multidimensional experience than
even a highly discursive in-person lecture.</span></p><p><strong><span>Text chat:</span></strong><span> As a backchannel, a means of quickly exchanging links to
relevant resources, a channel for collaborative note-taking, a way of
communicating with the lecturer and with other participants, text chat
adds a particularly useful dimension to real-time peeragogical meetings
-- especially when the division of labor is explicitly agreed upon in
advance. We've found that even in meetings that use the real-time
collaborative editor </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://etherpad.org" target="_blank">Etherpad</a><span> for collaborative
note taking, participants may gravitate toward the built-in chat box for
discussion.</span></p><p><strong><span>Screen sharing:</span></strong><span> The ability of participants to show each other what is
on their screens becomes especially important in peer learning, where we
all have some things to show each other.</span></p><p><strong><span>Web tours:</span></strong><span> An alternative to screen-sharing is the ability to display
the same web page(s) to all participants by entering URLs.</span></p><p><strong><span>Interactive whiteboards</span></strong><span>: A shared space that enables participants to
enter text, drawings, shapes, colors, to move and resize media, and to
import graphic content -- especially if it allows anonymous actions --
can foster the feeling of participating in a collective intelligence.
Collaborative anonymous mind-mapping of the discussion is one technique
to try with whiteboards. The whiteboard can also be used to generate an
emergent agenda for an "un-meeting".</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="configuring-google+-hangout---a-free-alternative-for-up-to-10-people"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Configuring Google+ Hangout - a free alternative for up to 10 people</span></span></h1><section><p><span>For up to 10 people, each equipped with a webcam, microphone, and

Hangout</a><span> can provide high-quality audio-video conferencing. By enabling
the text-chat feature and adding Google Docs (text documents,
presentations, or spreadsheets), screensharing, and SketchUp
(whiteboard), it is possible to emulate most of what the commercial
services offer.  Adobe Connect and Blackboard Collaborate currently have
the user-interface advantage of displaying chat, video,
whiteboard/slides as resizable panes on one screen; at present, the free
Google services can provide a powerful extension of the basic
audio-video platform, but participants have to shift between different
tabs or windows in the browser. Note that it is possible to</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html" target="_blank">stream a
Hangout and record it to YouTube</a><span>, again at no cost to the user.  We've

co-learning encouraged participants to suggest and shape active roles
during real-time meetings. By creating and taking on roles, and shifting
from role to role, participants engage in a kind of collective learning
about collective learning which can be as pleasurable as well as useful.
Typically we first brainstorm, then analyze, then organize and present
the knowledge that we discover, construct, and ultimately convey
together.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="roles-for-participants-in-real-time-meetings"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Roles for participants in real-time meetings</span></span></h1><section><ul><li><p><span>*Searchers:* search the web for references mentioned during the
