from over-promising or over-committing, and subsequently crashing and
burning?</span></p><p><span>First, let's be clear that there are lots of ways things can go wrong.
Simplistic expectations -- like </span><em><span>assuming that others will do the work
for you</span></em><span> [13] -- can undermine your ability to correctly gauge your own
strengths, weaknesses, and commitments.  Without careful, critical
engagement, you might not even notice when there's a problem. Where
one person has trouble letting go, others may have trouble speaking
up.  Pressure builds when communication isn't going well.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution</span></span><span class="firn-org-tags"><span><a class="firn-org-tag" href="/tags#key">key</a></span></span></h1><section><p><span>Serious frustration is a sign that it's time to revisit the group's and
your own individual plan.  Are these realistic?</span></p><p><span>If you have a "buddy" they can provide a reality check. Maybe things
are not </span><em><span>that hard</span></em><span> after all -- and maybe they don't need to be done</span><em><span>right now</span></em><span>.  Generalizing from this: the project can promote an open
dialog by creating opportunities for people to share their worries and
generate an emergent plan for addressing them [10].</span></p><p><span>Use the project </span><a class="firn-internal" href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a><span> to make note of obstacles.</span></p><p><span>For example, if you'd like to pass a baton, you'll need someone there
who can take it.  Maybe you can't find that person right away, but you
can bring up the concern and get it onto the project's.  The situation
is always changing, but if we continue to create suitable checkpoints
and benchmarks, then we can take steps to take care of an issue that's
getting bogged down.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Think of the project as an ecosystem populated by acts of participation.
As we get to know more about ourselves and each other, we know what
sorts of things we can expect, and we are able to work together more
sustainably [6]. We moderate stress and improve collective outcomes by
taking concerns seriously.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="resolution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Resolution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Guiding and rebalancing behavior in a social context can begin with
speaking up about a concern.  When we acknowledge concerns, we must
take into account our own boundedness. We have find an opportunity to
make ourselves helpful, without impinging on others'</span><strong><span>independence</span></strong><span>. This doesn't mean allowing all possible stresses to run
rampant: we work to stay within the realm of </span><strong><span>antifragility</span></strong><span>, where
manageable stress </span><em><span>improves</span></em><span> the system rather than degrading it [12].
As we share concerns and are met with care and practical support, our
actions begin to align better with expectations (often as a result of
forming more realistic expectations).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="example-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example 1</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Wikipedia aims to emphasize a neutral point of view, but its users are
