## Patterns of Peeragogy

This chapter outlines an approach to the organization of learning that
draws on the principles of free/libre/open source software (FLOSS), free
culture, and peer production. Mako Hill suggests that one recipe for
success in peer production is to take a familiar idea – for example, an
encyclopedia – and make it easy for people to participate in building it
<span class="citation">\[11\]</span>. We will take hold of “learning in
institutions” as a map, although it does not
fully conform to our chosen tacitly-familiar territory of *peeragogy*.
To be clear, peeragogy is for *any group of people who want to learn
anything*.[^fn1]

*A prototypical university. Caption reads: Wisconsin State University, Madison, Wis. 1879. Inset captions describe the pictured buildings: Ladies Hall, South Dormitory, University Hall, Assembly Halls & Library, North Dormitory, Science Hall, President’s Residence, University Farm, and Washburn Observatory. Public domain.*

Despite thinking about learning and adaptation that may take place far
outside of formal institutions, the historical conception of a
university helps give shape to our inqury. The model university is not
separate from the life of the state or its citizenry, but aims to
“assume leadership in the application of knowledge for the direct
improvement of the life of the people in every sphere” <span
class="citation">\[8\]</span>. Research that *adds to the store of
knowledge* is another fundamental obligation of the university <span
class="citation">\[8\]</span>. The university provides a familiar model
for collaborative knowledge work but it is not the only model available.
Considering the role of collaboration in building Wikipedia,
StackExchange, and free/libre/open source software development, we may
be led to ask: What might an accredited free/libre/open university look
like? How would it compare or contrast with the typical or stereotypical
image of a university from Figure \[madison-map\]? Would it have similar
structural features, like a Library, Dormitory, Science Hall and so on?
Would participants take on familiar roles <span
class="citation">\[5\]</span>? How would it compare with historical
efforts like the Tuskegee Institute that involved students directly in
the production of physical infrastructure <span
class="citation">\[7,19\]</span>? We use the word *peeragogy* to talk
about collaboration in relatively non-hierarchical settings. Examples
are found in education, but also in business, government, volunteer, and
NGO settings. Peeragogy involves both problem solving and problem
definition. Indeed, in many cases it is preferable to focus on
solutions, since people know the “problems” all too well <span
class="citation">\[2\]</span>. Participants in a peeragogical endeavor
collaboratively build emergent structures that are responsive to their
changing context, and that in turn, change that context. In the
Peeragogy project, we are developing the the theory and practice of
peeragogy.

*Design patterns* offer a methodological framework that we have used to
clarify our focus and organize our work. A design pattern expresses a
commonly-occurring problem, a solution to that problem, and rationale
for choosing this solution <span class="citation">\[13\]</span>. This
skeleton is typically fleshed out with a *pattern template* that
includes additional supporting material; individual patterns are
connected with each other in a *pattern language*. What we present here
is rather different from previous pattern languages that touch on
similar topics – like *Liberating Voices* <span
class="citation">\[17\]</span>, *Pedagogical Patterns* <span
class="citation">\[3\]</span>, and *Learning Patterns* <span
class="citation">\[12\]</span>. At the level of the pattern template,
our innovation is simply to add a “What’s next” annotation, which
anticipates the way the pattern will continue to “resolve”.

This addition mirrors the central considerations of our approach, which
is all about human interaction, and the challenges, fluidity and
unpredictability that come with it. Something that works for one person
may not work for another or may not even work for the same person in a
slightly different situation. We need to be ready to clarify and adjust
what we do as we go. Even so, it is hard to argue with a
sensible-sounding formula like “If W applies, do X to get Y.” In our
view, other pattern languages often achieve this sort of common sense
rationality, and then stop. Failure in the prescriptive model only
begins when people try to define things more carefully and make
context-specific changes – when they actually try to put ideas into
practice. The problem lies in the inevitable distance between *do as I
say*, *do as I do*, and *do with me* <span
class="citation">\[9\]</span>. If people are involved, things get messy.
They may think that they are on the same page, only to find out that
their understandings are wildly different. For example, everyone may
agree that the group needs to go “that way.” But how far? How fast? It
is rare for a project to be able to set or even define all of the
parameters accurately and concisely at the beginning. And yet design
becomes a “living language” <span class="citation">\[1\]</span> just
insofar as it is linked to action. Many things have changed since
Alexander suggested that “you will get the most ‘power’ over the
language, and make it your own most effectively, if you write the
changes in, at the appropriate places in the book” <span
class="citation">\[1\]</span>. We see more clearly what it means to
inscribe the changing form of design not just in the margins of a book,
or even a shared wiki, but in the lifeworld itself. Other recent authors
on patterns share similar views <span
class="citation">\[15,16,18\]</span>.

Learning and collaboration are of interest to both organizational
studies and computer science, where researchers are increasingly making
use of social approaches to software design and development, as well as
agent-based models of computation <span
class="citation">\[6,14\]</span>. The design pattern community in
particular is very familiar with practices that we think of as
peeragogical, including shepherding, writers workshops, and design
patterns themselves <span class="citation">\[4,10,13\]</span>.

Pattern template 
----------------

The table below shows the pattern template that we use to
present our patterns.  Along with the traditional design patterns
components <span class="citation">\[13\]</span>, each of our patterns is
fleshed out with two illustrative examples. The first is descriptive,
and looks at how the pattern applies in current Wikimedia projects. We
selected Wikimedia as a source of examples because the project is
familiar, a demonstrated success, and readily accessible. The second
example shows how the pattern could be applied in the design of a future
university. Each pattern concludes with a boxed annotation: “*What’s
Next in the Peeragogy Project*”.

A short motivating example 
--------------------------

When one relative <span><span>Newcomer</span></span> was still in the
onboarding process in Peeragogy project, she hit a wall in understanding
the “patterns” section in the *Peeragogy Handbook* v1. A more seasoned
peer invited her to a series of separate discussions with their own
<span><span>Heartbeat</span></span> to flesh out the patterns and make
them more accessible. At that time the list of patterns was simply a
list of paragraphs describing recurrent trends. During those sessions,
the impact and meaning of patterns captured her imagination. She went on
to become the champion for the pattern language and its application in
the Peeragogy project. During a “hive editing” session, she proposed the
template we initially used to give structure to the patterns. She helped
further revise the pattern language for the *Peeragogy Handbook* v3, and
attended PLoP 2015. While a new domain can easily be overwhelming, this
newcomer found <span><span>A specific project</span></span> to start
with, and scaffolded her knowledge and contributions from that
foundation.
