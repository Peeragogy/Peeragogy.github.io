Real-time meeting media
-----------------------

The *Peeragogy Handbook* was conceived and constructed by a group of
people on four continents who had not met and had not known about each
other before we began meeting online. The process involves asynchronous
media, including forums, wikis, social bookmarking groups, and
Wordpress, but it probably would never have cohered into a group capable
of collective action if it had not been for the real-time meetings where
we were able to see each other’s faces, hear each other’s voices, use a
whiteboard as an anonymous agenda-generator, exchange links in chat,
show each other examples through screen-sharing. Together, the
asynchronous and real-time media enabled us to begin to see ourselves as
an effective group. We used both real-time and asynchronous tools to
work out processes for creating, refining, and publishing the Handbook,
to divide labor, decide on platforms and processes, to collaboratively
compose and edit articles, and to design and add graphical and video
elements. In particular, we used the [Blackboard
Collaborate](http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx)
platform, a web-service that enables up to 50 people at a time to meet
in a multimedia, recordable, meeting room for around \$500/year. We’ve
experimented with other paid platforms, such as [Adobe
Connect](http://success.adobe.com/en/na/sem/products/connect/1109_6011_connect_webinars.html)
(about the same price as Collaborate), and when we meet in groups of ten
or less, we often use the free and recordable [Google+
Hangout](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) service. Smaller
groups also use [Skype](http://www.skype.com) or free telephone
conferencing services.  [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) is an
open source audio-only tool that is popular with gamers. We’re watching
the development of [Big Blue Button](http://www.bigbluebutton.org/), a
free and open-source real-time meeting platform, as it develops the full
suite of tools that are currently only available for a fee. Dozens of
other free, ad-supported and/or freemium webconferencing systems such as
[Big Marker](http://www.bigmarker.com/about) and
[Dim-Dim](http://www.dimdim.com) can be found in lists like [Howard
Rheingold’s](http://delicious.com/hrheingold/webconferencing) and [Robin
Good’s](http://www.mindmeister.com/12213323/best-online-collaboration-tools-2012-robin-good-s-collaborative-map)
(see links at the end of this chapter). Free phone conferencing services
provide another technological “lowest common denominator”: some provide
a few extras like downloadable recordings.

Features of real-time meeting platforms
---------------------------------------

There are many free services for chat, screen-sharing, whiteboards, and
video conferencing, but combining all these components in separate panes
of the same screen (preferably) or as separate tabs of a browser can
have a powerful synchronizing and harmonizing effect on the group. The
features to look for in meeting platforms include:

**Audio and video**: Choose platforms that enable
voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) and easy ways for participants to
configure their microphones and speakers. Today’s webcams, together with
adequate lighting and a broadband connection, enable a number of people
to be visible at the same time. In Blackboard Collaborate, the person
who is speaking at a given moment is visible in the largest video pane,
while other participants are available in smaller video windows. Audio
and video convey much more of a human dimension than text communications
alone. A group of people who have seen and heard each other online are
able to work together via asynchronous media such as forums and wikis
more effectively. Online face-to-face meetings are often the best way
for a group to argue constructively and decide on critical issues.
Forums and email are comparatively bad choices for distributed
decison-making.

**Slide pushing:** The best platforms will convert .ppt or .pdf files
for sequential display. With the addition of text chat, annotations to
slides, and the ability to “raise your hand” or interrupt with your
voice, an online lecture can be a more multidimensional experience than
even a highly discursive in-person lecture.

**Text chat:** As a backchannel, a means of quickly exchanging links to
relevant resources, a channel for collaborative note-taking, a way of
communicating with the lecturer and with other participants, text chat
adds a particularly useful dimension to real-time peeragogical meetings
– especially when the division of labor is explicitly agreed upon in
advance. We’ve found that even in meetings that use the real-time
collaborative editor [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) for collaborative
note taking, participants may gravitate toward the built-in chat box for
discussion.

**Screen sharing:** The ability of participants to show each other what
is on their screens becomes especially important in peer learning, where
we all have some things to show each other.

**Web tours:** An alternative to screen-sharing is the ability to
display the same web page(s) to all participants by entering URLs.

**Interactive whiteboards**: A shared space that enables participants to
enter text, drawings, shapes, colors, to move and resize media, and to
import graphic content – especially if it allows anonymous actions – can
foster the feeling of participating in a collective intelligence.
Collaborative anonymous mind-mapping of the discussion is one technique
to try with whiteboards. The whiteboard can also be used to generate an
emergent agenda for an “un-meeting”.

Configuring Google+ Hangout - a free alternative for up to 10 people
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For up to 10 people, each equipped with a webcam, microphone, and
broadband connection, [Google+
Hangout](http://lifehacker.com/5842191/google%252B-hangouts-adds-screen-sharing-google-docs-collaboration-and-more)
can provide high-quality audio-video conferencing. By enabling the
text-chat feature and adding Google Docs (text documents, presentations,
or spreadsheets), screensharing, and SketchUp (whiteboard), it is
possible to emulate most of what the commercial services offer.  Adobe
Connect and Blackboard Collaborate currently have the user-interface
advantage of displaying chat, video, whiteboard/slides as resizable
panes on one screen; at present, the free Google services can provide a
powerful extension of the basic audio-video platform, but participants
have to shift between different tabs or windows in the browser. Note
that it is possible to [stream a Hangout and record it to
YouTube](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html), again
at no cost to the user.  We’ve used this tool extensively in the
Peeragogy project.

Suggestions for real-time meetings
----------------------------------

In the nine online courses I have facilitated, the emphasis on
co-learning encouraged participants to suggest and shape active roles
during real-time meetings. By creating and taking on roles, and shifting
from role to role, participants engage in a kind of collective learning
about collective learning which can be as pleasurable as well as useful.
Typically we first brainstorm, then analyze, then organize and present
the knowledge that we discover, construct, and ultimately convey
together.

Roles for participants in real-time meetings
--------------------------------------------

-   **Searchers:** search the web for references mentioned during the
    session and other resources relevant to the discussion, and publish
    the URLs in the text chat
-   **Contextualizers:** add two or three sentences of contextual
    description for each URL
-   **Summarizers:** note main points made through text chat.
-   **Lexicographers:** identify and collaboratively define words and
    phrases on a wiki page.
-   **Mappers:** keep track of top level and secondary level categories
    and help the group mindmapping exercise at the end of the session.
-   **Curators:** compile the summaries, links to the lexicon and
    mindmaps, contextualized resources, on a single wiki page.
-   **Emergent Agendas:** using the whiteboard for anonymous nomination
    and preference polling for agenda items, with voice, video, and
    text-chat channels for discussing nominations, a group can quickly
    set its own agenda for the real-time session.

The Paragogical Action Review
-----------------------------

Charlie Danoff and Joe Corneli slightly modified the US Army’s “After
Action Review” into a technique for evaluating peer learning as it
happens.  The five steps in the “PAR” are:

1.  Review what was supposed to happen

2.  Establish what is happening

3.  Determine what’s right and wrong with what we are doing

4.  What did we learn or change?

5.  What else should we change going forward?

Participants can run through these steps during live meetings to
reassess the medium, the readings, the group dynamics, or any other
choices that have learning relevance. The focus in the PAR is on change:
as such, it provides a simple way to help implement the “double loop
learning” described Chris Argris <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>.
