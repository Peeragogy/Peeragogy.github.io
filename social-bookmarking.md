**What is Social Bookmarking?**

***Social bookmarking*** lets you share online links and resources among
many other people, both publicly and in closed groups. Bookmarks are
stored and shared “in the cloud,” tagged or labeled with commons or
unique sets of labels for group use.

## Possible Features:

-   **Easy Add-Ons:** Users can install a bookmarklet or browser add-on
    that enables them to select a snippet of text from any web page
    and/or write their own brief description of that web page, add
    appropriate tags, and save the bookmark in a way that makes it
    available to others.
-   **Searchable:** Users can find bookmarks by going through
    collections of bookmarks, searching through tags, or browsing their
    (or their group’s) library of bookmarks.
-   **URLs or Blogrolls for Collections:** Some social bookmarking
    services make it possible to send others a unique URL for an entire
    [collection of bookmarks](https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://delicious.com/hrheingold/socialbookmarking "Howard Rheingold's Delicious Bookmarks").
-   **Public/Private:** Some services make it possible to create public
    or private groups; whenever one person bookmarks a resource, it
    becomes visible to all group members in the group library.
-   **Email Digests:** Group members can opt to receive daily or weekly
    emails with all the bookmarks & snippets from members of that group.
-   **Highlighting/Annotation:** Some services (i.e.,
    [Diigo](https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://www.diigo.com/))
    enable individuals to highlight specific passages of text and
    create unique URLs they can share with others that display that web
    page with their highlighted passages; other members of a Diigo group
    can add “sticky note” comments to pages, attached to specific
    highlighted passages, and comment on the comments.
-   **Themes or Groupings:** Some services (i.e.,
    [Delicious](https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://delicious.com/))
    enable users to create collections of thematically-related bookmarks
    with several tags (“Stacks”) and share them. Some services (i.e.
    [Pearltrees](https://web.archive.org/web/20130117035257/http://peeragogy.org/social-bookmarking/www.pearltrees.com/))
    enable teams to add bookmarks to collections.

## How would a peeragogy group use social bookmarking?

-   A group can agree on criteria for bookmarking resources about their
    particular topic, and agree upon a set of tags.
-   Using a group or team feature, individual members of a peeragogy
    group can add bookmarks that are available in various ways to other
    members of the group.
-   This kind of service can be particularly useful when gathering
    resources as candidates for a self-organized syllabus — services
    that enable discussions of particular texts can help member of a
    group decide how to qualify and prioritize resources.

## Things to keep in mind

-   Does the service enable groups or teams?
-   Can groups be private?
-   Can individuals and groups highlight passages, leave notes attached
    to passages, engage in comment threads about bookmarks, make
    collections, share unique URLs for particular tags, combinations of
    tags, or collections?
-   Can lists be accessed offline?
-   Can results be exported and/or backed up if the service changes its
    ownership or its terms?
