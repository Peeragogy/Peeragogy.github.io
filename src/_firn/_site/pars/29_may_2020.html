Takashi has previously combined "patterns" and "futures" in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVCzQM-KQ50
Charlotte has some of his publications in her personal library, so we could use some of examples under fair use.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What did we learn or change?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Vitor pointed out that he has an asynchronous game that works well with language learners — and we talked about what we could do with a simple pattern game.  We also talked about the relationship between "patterns" and "futures", realising that we might not be the first people to think about this, but there doesn't seem to be that much written.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what-else-should-we-change-going-forward?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What else should we change going forward?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We'll review some of Takashi's published patterns, including his pattern-for-producing-patterns.  Hopefully we can make a bit of progress on this before we meet him next.  We'll also hope to make some of our own cards (in the style he uses), and have a good look again at the core "futures" literature that we want to be citing & building on in the paper.</span></p></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/pars/wrap_march">Wrap March</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="/PARs">Pars 2020</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body></html>
