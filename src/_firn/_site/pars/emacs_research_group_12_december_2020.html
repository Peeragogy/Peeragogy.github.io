LV: Thinking I was speaking a lot
JC: Leo had a bit of crackle
LV: wants to try to give voice
Telephone interface perspective — others may want to join by phone
Jitsi could be an opportunity
BBB has some extra features? FSF controls.
You need to be a sponsor of FSF to use their Jitsi, but not sure if they support phone calls
David: thanks for being patient w/ me as non-researcher answering my questions about Org Roam!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="4-what-did-we-learn-or-change?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>4.

Can also have Leo be ongoing moderator if he’s up for that!
David’s tutorial material will be ready to look at
NA: Will want some help to set up + use the tech
Many can look into the Logseq/OR/Firn ecosystem
Meeting w/ Jethro can be challenging (but worth it)
Leo, please follow up w/ JC about paper!
Meta-review of PARs later?
DOT+LV, looking at Peeragogy book
Allow up to 2 hours to discuss? — But we will put all the key things in 1st hour
Use David’s 1-to-1 as a template
Schedule further 1-to-1s for January?
Meeting 19th — followed by break</span></p></section></div></div></div><div><hr /><div class="backlinks"><h4>Backlinks to this document:</h4><ul class="firn-backlinks"><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="http://localhost:4000/pars/research_on_with_in_emacs">Research on/with/in Emacs</a></li><li class="firn-backlink"><a href="http://localhost:4000/PARs">Pars 2020</a></li></ul></div></div></article></main></body></html>
