peer learning and peer production!! You may already be familiar with
these terms, or they may be new to you. Either way, don't worry!!!</span></p><p><span>If they are new, consider the following 2 examples.</span></p><ol><li><p><em><span>Peer learning</span></em><span>: Joe Corneli needs to get from the suburbs of Chicago
   to the north side of the city. He gets on the commuter train and
   transfers to the purple "L" at Davis Street in Evanston. He plans to
   change to the red line at Howard Street, but the train says "Loop"
   and he asks another passenger whether it will stop at Howard. She
   says it will, but that he can save an hour of his time by riding
   express to the city and then coming back two stops! Joe makes it to
   his meeting with Charlie with plenty of time to spare.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>Peer production</span></em><span>: Two cavewomen see lightning strike a tree and
   produce fire! Walking up to it they notice the heat and think
   "Wouldn't it be nice to have fire for our family at night!" Once the
   rain clears, they find some dry sticks and start working together to
   figure out how they can use them to start their own flame. After
   hours of trial and error, BOOM they've got fire! The news travels
   fast. :)</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Peeragogy is an approach to learning and working together on projects
ranging from the mundane to the monumental. Peer learning and peer
production are probably as old as humanity itself, but they take on new
importance in the digital age.</span></p><p><span>The Peeragogy Project is an informal learning project with members
worldwide. Three members of the project share their welcoming messages
below.</span></p><p><strong><span>Paola Ricaurte Quijano</span></strong><span>: Welcome to the Peeragogy Project! We are a
group of enthusiastic people who love to learn and are trying to find
the best ways to learn together.</span></p><p><strong><span>Lisa Snow MacDonald</span></strong><span>: Welcome to peeragogy! It's kind of a weird name,
but it's enormously powerful in providing a fresh understanding of ways
of working together.</span></p><p><strong><span>Dorotea Mar</span></strong><span>: Your contributions will be really welcome if you
participate respectfully and harmoniously with other peers. It can
change your life and improve your well­being and make everything better.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="a-peeragogy-interview"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A Peeragogy Interview</span></span></h1><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="introductions"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Introductions</span></span></h2><section><p><strong><span>Paola Ricaurte Quijano</span></strong><span>: Hi! I'm Paola, I'm from Ecuador. I work at
Tecnológico de Monterrey, a private university in Mexico City, and I
love to learn with everybody!</span></p><p><strong><span>Dorotea Mar</span></strong><span>: Hello. I'm in Berlin now and I really like the
peeragogical atmosphere of collaboration and I think we are really
improving ways of collaboration and peer production, so that's why I'm
here.</span></p><p><strong><span>Lisa Snow MacDonald</span></strong><span>: Hello. This is Lisa from Los Angeles. My
background is media psychology and I'm interested in peeragogy as it
relates to business.</span></p><p><em><span>What is peer learning/production?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> Well, peer learning. learning with peers, learning from peers and
trying to make things together or make things happen together. I think
that for me, the most important thing I've learned from this experience
is that you can achieve more when you work together and set goals
together.</span></p><p><strong><span>LSM</span></strong><span> I think what peeragogy does is it allows us to recognize the value
of those connections. A lot of other ways of working are more
individualized. It goes back to a concept of 1 + 1 = 2, which is very
rational and very measured and is kind of a dominant way of thinking in
our society today, whereas peer to peer learning and production
recognize the value of those connections. You may not be able to measure
it with a yardstick, but we understand that there is value in those
connections. So it's basically acknowledging that when it comes to
learning/collaborative environments if constructed the right way if
working well it can be 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 = 4. That type of situation,
which is really different from the way we're used to thinking about
things. And I think that's really the value of what we're doing and the
potential of what we could hopefully unlock.</span></p><p><em><span>More specifically, what is peeragogy and/or what is the Peeragogy
Project?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> This is a project that began spontaneously. We didn't have a plan
at the beginning. We just talked about the things that concerned us the
most. What do you need if you want to learn with others, how to learn
better? what do you want to learn? Where do you want to learn? When do
you want to learn? Basic questions that can be answered in many ways. We
don't have a strict line. We have a map, maybe, but a map that can be
walked through by many different paths. Paths that you choose can be
related to the people you are working with. I think it's been a great
experience for us. As Lisa said, we have been recognizing the talents
and strengths of every person that has contributed to and participated
in this project.</span></p><p><strong><span>LSM</span></strong><span> OK. I'll take my best shot with this. Going back to what I said
earlier and building off what other people have said. Because we don't
have a good mental construct of how this works, and measurement is
difficult. We haven't learned how to measure these connections. I think
what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project can do is it can establish what
people have said about focusing on the process. It can help people
understand the process better. Because this lack of structure can be
uncomfortable for people. We need to understand when that discomfort is
acceptable, so they don't revert and become counter­productive
participants in the process. The map analogy that Paola just mentioned,
is really good too. It's not about providing a direct path. If you're on
a trip trying to get from LA to Chicago, there's many paths you can
take. It's making sure you're monitoring your resources and you're
taking care of things along the way. You can drift off-course. One plus
one can equal zero if things don't work out well. So, what peeragogy and
the Peeragogy Project can do is to provide some structure and framework
around the unstructured way that things can be done. People trying to
make sure their methods are constructive and beneficial now have some
guidelines and things to watch out for.</span></p><hr /></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example:-howard-rheingold-grows-a-learning-network"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example: Howard Rheingold Grows a Learning Network</span></span></h2><section><p><span>"When I started using social media in the classroom, I looked for and
began to learn from more experienced educators. First, I read and then
tried to comment usefully on their blog posts and tweets. When I began
to understand who knew what in the world of social media in education, I
narrowed my focus to the most knowledgeable and adventurous among them.
I paid attention to the people the savviest social media educators paid
attention to. I added and subtracted voices from my attention network,
listened and followed, then commented and opened conversations. When I
found something I thought would interest the friends and strangers I was
learning from, I passed along my own learning through my blogs and
Twitter stream. I asked questions, asked for help, and eventually
started providing answers and assistance to those who seemed to know
less than I. The teachers I had been learning from had a name for what I
was doing --- “growing a personal learning network." So I started
looking for and learning from people who talked about HOW to grow a
"PLN" as the enthusiasts called them.”</span></p><hr /><p><em><span>How do you do peeragogy?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>DM</span></strong><span> I think I do a lot of peeragogy and I'm very happy about it because
I learn so much from my group and from myself in this group that I like
to apply it to other projects that I'm in or things like co­working and
co­living projects. Especially the principle of mutual respect that
still remains after a very long time. And the way we relate to each
other is really nice.</span></p><p><span>The main principle is mutual respect and openness, and the process. And
in each detail, there is value that we believe in.</span></p><p><span>Let's say how we manage the Peeragogy Page or Community (See "How to Get
Involved," later in this chapter.). These seem to be details, but
they're actually really important. So if we pay attention to all these,
every little thing matters, and this is how I do it. I try to be very
mindful in all interactions.</span></p><p><img src="/images/talking.jpg" /></p><hr /></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example:-learner,-know-thyself"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example: Learner, know thyself.</span></span></h2><section><p><span>When he joined the Peeragogy project in 2012, Charles Jeffrey Danoff did
a brief self­evaluation about what makes him interested in learning:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Context. As a student, I resisted being groomed for some
   unforeseeable future. I'd rather work toward a specific goal.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Timing and sequence. I find learning fun when I'm studying something
   as a way to procrastinate another pressing assignment.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Social reinforcement. Getting tips from peers on how to navigate a
   snowboard around moguls was more fun for me than my Dad showing me
   the proper way to buff the car's leather seats on chore day.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Experiential awareness. In high school, it was not fun to sit and
   compose a 30-page reading journal on Frankenstein. But owing in part
   to those types of prior experiences, I now find writing pleasurable
   and it's fun to learn how to write better.</span></p></li></ol><hr /><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> I think peeragogy is more like a mind­set. I think we have to
change the way we interact with others and the way we understand the
parameters of learning. For example, I'm a teacher and, of course, my
teaching practice promotes collaborative, creative learning. So, I
expect my students to take responsibility for their own learning by
making decisions about most aspects of the learning process; to program
their own learning goals. They need to learn to effectively employ the
environments (like whiteboards), the activities, and the assessments.
I'm trying to give my learners the tools to decide how, what, and why
they want to learn. For me, it's been a very interesting experience.
Learners often find it unfamiliar to make their own decisions about the
process in a formal environment. At the beginning of the semester,
students are given everything and usually just follow guidelines and
criteria. I have been trying to change this dynamic. Students feel
insecure, because they really do not know how or what they want to do.
So, that process of making decisions together becomes very rich and very
meaningful.</span></p><p><img src="/images/footprints.jpg" /></p><hr /></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example:-metacognition-and-mindfulness"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example: Metacognition and Mindfulness</span></span></h2><section><blockquote><p><span>  Alan Schoenfeld: "What (exactly) are you doing? Can you describe it
  precisely? Why are you doing it? How does it fit into the solution?
  How does it help you? What will you do with the outcome when you
  obtain it?" [1]</span></p></blockquote><hr /><p><em><span>When do you do peeragogy?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>DM</span></strong><span> I think I'm always practicing it. I really like that during the
weekly hangouts we don't usually have rigid agendas. We just get
creative and let ideas connect and flow. And whatever happens it's the
right thing. We just work together and somehow the right things happen.
I think we're always doing peeragogy when we pursue activities and
projects in open, collaborative ways without imposing too much structure
or heirarchy.</span></p><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> I agree with Dorotea. The where and when questions are related. If
you're thinking about where, you're thinking about when. So if "where"
is everywhere, and "when" is always, I agree. Anywhere, everywhere, all
the time. It's an ongoing process. If you believe in peeragogy as a way
of doing things or making things happen, you cannot switch back and
forth betweeen two different personas and say, "I'm not working with
peeragogy now," or "I am applying peeragogy now."</span></p><p><strong><span>LSM</span></strong><span> I'm familiar with the business world where there are distinct
personalities. For example there are people who tend to be more
collaborative just by nature, who tend to adapt and to prefer a
peeragogical model. Other personalities are less so, and that's why what
we're doing here is valuable. In practice, there's seldom a conscious
recognition of these different styles of working. In a business
environment, there are different motivators, different personalities
tossed together, all united by a single goal. So understanding
peeragogical vs. heirarchical practices, and raising the differences to
the surface, could be very valuable in pursuing the goal of making
people's lives better in the business environment.</span></p><p><strong><span>DM</span></strong><span> There are many collaborative projects that aim to do something
similar to this, but, in a sense, focus on different aspects of the
process, and maybe not on such an abstract level as we might.</span></p><p><span>Some people have natural peeragogical tendencies, and some people are
less transparent in the way they do things. For me, peeragogy is really
beneficial, especially for collaborative projects. Everybody works and
learns differently, so if everyone became increasingly aware of how they
and others work and learn, of how peergogy functions, and how it all
fits into a bigger picture, many tasks would not only be more
efficiently done, but also much more enjoyable. It's also beneficial if
everyone focusses on a bigger picture instead of focussing only on their
part of it, and if attention is drawn to all that could be done in a
peeragogical way.</span></p><hr /></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example:-jay-cross-on-setting-sail"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example: Jay Cross on Setting Sail</span></span></h2><section><p><span>"If I were an instructional designer in a moribund training department,
I'd polish up my resume and head over to marketing. Co­learning can
differentiate services, increase product usage, strengthen customer
relationships, and reduce the cost of hand­holding. It's cheaper and
more useful than advertising. But instead of just making a copy of
today's boring educational practices, build something based on
interaction and camaraderie, perhaps with some healthy competition
thrown in. Again, the emphasis should always be on learning in order to
do something!"</span></p><hr /><p><em><span>Why do you do peeragogy?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> Why? Well, as said before, I believe in peeragogy. I believe it's
a good way to learn. Maybe it's the best way. I think I wasn't aware of
that before joining the group. I have always been a self­learner, I have
been working mostly alone. After I began working with the group, I
understood that you grow working with a group. You achieve things that
you aren't able to achieve alone. I think there's a growing awareness of
the value of collaboration in every setting and environment. There are
more and more learning communities around the world where people are
also learning that making decisions together and working together are
the best way to be in this world! I think as we live through hard times,
we increasingly need a sense that we are not alone and that we cannot
solve problems alone.</span></p><p><em><span>How did you join the Peeragogy project?</span></em></p><p><strong><span>PRQ</span></strong><span> After taking Howard Rheingold's course on Mind Amplifiers in 2012
we were invited to join this group. There was no plan, just an open
question of how to best learn with others.\\
That's how it began. We had lots of sessions and discussed a wide range
of issues. The Peeragogy Handbook (http://peeragogy.org) was the product
of that process. We've been working with the Handbook, releasing a new
version every year and trying to figure out what might be the best way
to go forward and what the future of our collaboration as a group/team
might be.</span></p><p><strong><span>LSM</span></strong><span> A couple friends of mine were involved in P2P learning. They were
invited to a conference at UCI. Howard was at the event and they were
familiar with him and his work. We ended up in an obscure classroom and
he started talking about principles that were peeragogy related, while I
don't know if it provided much value to my friends, it sounded a lot
like what I saw in business and he mentioned the group. So after that, I
met everyone here and it's been pretty random.</span></p><p><strong><span>DM</span></strong><span> I think many paths led to my involvement. I have a lot of academic
experience and was doing research on Open Science. I had always wanted
to improve the way things work and somehow I wanted to do it more
creatively. I resonated a lot with the Peeragogy Project on many levels,
so somehow I just joined, I think it was serendipity of some kind.</span></p><p><span>This interview was conducted on December 15th, 2014. The transcript was
