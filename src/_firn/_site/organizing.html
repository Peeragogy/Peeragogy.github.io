learning always happens in a context, whether this context is a
structured "course" or a (potentially) less structured "learning space".
For the moment we consider the following division:</span></p><ul><li><p><em><span>Organizing Co-learning Contexts</span></em></p><ul><li><p><span>Courses ("linked to a timeline or syllabus")</span></p></li><li><p><span>Spaces ("not linked to a timeline or syllabus")</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>This section focuses on existing learning contexts and examines in
detail how they have been "organized" by their .  At a "meta-level" of
development, we can talk about this parallel structure:</span></p><ul><li><p><em><span>Building Co-learning Platforms</span></em></p><ul><li><p><span>Development trajectories (e.g. "design, implement, test, repeat")</span></p></li><li><p><span>Platform features (e.g. forums, wikis, ownership models, etc.)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span>A given learning environment will have both time-like and space-like
features as well as both designed-for and un-planned features. A given
learning platform will encourage certain types of engagement and impose
certain constraints. The question for both "teachers" and "system
designers" -- as well as for learners -- should be: </span><em><span>what features best
support learning?</span></em></p><p><span>The answer will depend on the learning task and available resources.</span></p><p><span>For example, many people believe that the best way to learn a foreign
language is through immersion. But not everyone who wants to learn, say,
French, can afford to drop everything to go live in a French-speaking
country. Thus, the space-like full immersion "treatment" is frequently
sacrificed for course-like treatments (either via books, CDs, videos, or
ongoing participation in semi-immersive discussion groups).</span></p><p><span>System designers are also faced with scarce resources: programmer time,
software licensing concerns, availability of peer support, and so forth.
While the ideal platform would (magically) come with solutions
pre-built, a more realistic approach recognizes that problem solving
always takes time and energy. The problem solving approach and
associated "learning orientation" will also depend on the task and
resources at hand. The following sections will develop this issue
further through some specific case studies.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="case-study-1:-&quot;paragogy&quot;-and-the-after-action-review"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Case Study 1: "Paragogy" and the After Action Review.</span></span></h1><section><p><span>In our analysis of our experiences as course organizers at P2PU, we (Joe
Corneli and Charlie Danoff) used the US Army's technique of After Action
Review (AAR). To quote from </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://paragogy.net/ParagogyPaper2" target="_blank">our
paper</a><span> [2]:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  As the name indicates, the AAR is used to review training exercises.
  It is important to note that while one person typically plays the role
  of evaluator in such a review [...] the review itself happens among
  peers, and examines the operations of the unit as a whole.</span></p><p><span>  The four steps in an AAR are:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Review what was supposed to happen (training plans).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Establish what happened.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Determine what was right or wrong with what happened.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Determine how the task should be done differently the next time.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>  The stated purpose of the AAR is to "identify strengths and
  shortcomings in unit planning, preparation, and execution, and guide
  leaders to accept responsibility for shortcomings and produce a fix."</span></p></blockquote><p><span>We combined the AAR with our paragogy principles --</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Changing context as a decentered center.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Meta-learning as a font of knowledge.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Peers provide feedback that wouldn't be there otherwise.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Paragogy is distributed and nonlinear.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Realize the dream if you can, then wake up!</span></p></li></ol><p><span>and went through steps 1-4 for each principle to look at how well it was
implemented at P2PU. This process helped generate new policies that
could be pursued further at P2PU or similar institutions. By presenting
our paper at the </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://okfn.org/okcon/" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Conference
(OKCon)</a><span>, we were able to meet P2PU's executive director, Philipp
Schmidt, as well as other highly-involved P2PU participants; our
feedback may ultimately have contributed to shaping the development
trajectory for P2PU.</span></p><p><span>In addition, we developed a strong prototype for constructive engagement
with peer learning that we and others could deploy again. In other
words, variants on the AAR and the paragogical principles could be
incorporated into future learning contexts as platform features [3] or
re-used in a design/administration/moderation approach [4].  For
example, we also used the AAR to help structure our writing and
subsequent work on </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://paragogy.net" target="_blank">paragogy.net</a><span>.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="case-study-2:-peeragogy,-year-one"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Case Study 2: Peeragogy, Year One.</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We surveyed members of the Peeragogy community with questions similar to

   here: we are studying "peeragogy" and yet many respondents did not
   feel they were really getting to know one another "as peers", at
   least not yet. Those who did have a "team" or who knew one another
   from previous experiences, felt more peer-like in those
   relationships. Several remarked that they learned less from other
   individual participants and more from "the collective" or "from
   everyone". At the same time, some respondents had ambiguous feelings
   about naming individuals in the first question: "I felt like I was
   going to leave people out and that that means they would get a bad
   grade - ha!" One criterion for being a peer was to have built
   something together, so by this criterion, it stands to reason that we
   would only slowly become peers through this project.</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>"Co-learning", "co-teaching", "co-producing"?</span></em><span> One respondent wrote:
   "I am learning about peeragogy, but I think I'm failing [to be] a
   good peeragogue. I remember that Howard [once] told us that the most
   important thing is that you should be responsible not only for your
   own learning but for your peers' learning. [...] So the question is,
   are we learning from others by ourselves or are we [...] helping
   others to learn?" Another wrote: "To my surprise I realized I could
   contribute organizationally with reviews, etc. And that I could
   provide some content around PLNs and group process. Trying to be a
   catalyst to a sense of forward movement and esprit de corps."</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>Weak structure at the outset, versus a more "flexible" approach.</span></em><span>
   One respondent wrote: "I definitely think I do better when presented
   with a framework or scaffold to use for participation or content
   development. [...] (But perhaps it is just that I'm used to the old
   way of doing things)." Yet, the same person wrote: "I am interested
   in [the] applicability [of peeragogy] to new models for
   entrepreneurship enabling less structured aggregation of participants
   in new undertakings, freed of the requirement or need for an
   entrepreneurial visionary/source/point person/proprietor." There is a
   sense that some confusion, particularly at the beginning, may be
   typical for peeragogy. With hindsight, one proposed "solution" would
   be to "have had a small group of people as a cadre that had met and
   brainstormed before the first live session [...] tasked [with] roles
   [and] on the same page".</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>Technological concerns.</span></em><span> There were quite a variety, perhaps mainly
   to do with the question: how might a (different) platform handle the
   tension between "conversations" and "content production"? For
   example, will Wordpress help us "bring in" new contributors, or would
   it be better to use an open wiki? Another respondent noted the
   utility for many readers of a take-away PDF version. The site
   (peeragogy.org) should be "[a] place for people to share, comment,
   mentor and co-learn together in an ongoing fashion."</span></p></li><li><p><em><span>Sample size.</span></em><span> Note that answers are still trickling in. How should
   we interpret the response rate? Perhaps what matters is that we are
   getting "enough" responses to make an analysis. One respondent
   proposed asking questions in a more ongoing fashion, e.g., asking
   people who are leaving: "What made you want to quit the project?"</span></p></li></ol></section></div></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="discussion"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Discussion</span></span></h1><section><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Lisewski and Joyce</span></strong><span>: In recent years, the tools, knowledge base and
  discourse of the learning technology profession has been bolstered by
  the appearance of conceptual paradigms such as the 'five stage
  e-moderating model' and the new mantra of 'communities of practice'.
  This paper will argue that, although these frameworks are useful in
  informing and guiding learning technology practice, there are inherent
  dangers in them becoming too dominant a discourse. [5]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Instead of a grand narrative, Peeragogy is a growing collection of case
studies and descriptive patterns.  As we share our experiences and make
needed adaptations, our techniques for doing peer learning and peer
production become more robust. Based on the experiences described above,
here are a few things people may want to try out in future projects:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>"Icebreaking" techniques or a "buddy system"; continual  refactoring
  into teams.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Maintain a process diagram that can be used to "triage" new ideas and
  effort.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Prefer the "good" to the "best", but make improvements at the platform
