consider trying to decipher a subway map in a foreign city. When the
idea or system is only "newly discovered", the associated meanings may
not be well understood, and indeed they may not have been created. Even
if a topic is only "personally new", it can be hard to find one's way

map-making is only one facet of shared human activity. For instance, a
pattern description can be thought of as a "micro-map" of a specific
activity. These maps are not useful if they are divorced from practice.
The process of creating a guide creates a certain formality to the
project, forcing participants to catalogue and explicate their idea.
Additionally, the act generally leads to deadlines which can help prod
individuals to work on the project more regularly.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="resolution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Resolution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Writing down this pattern clarifies the importance of creating a guide
