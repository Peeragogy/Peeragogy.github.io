draws on the principles of free/libre/open source software (FLOSS), free
culture, and peer production. Mako Hill suggests that one recipe for
success in peer production is to take a familiar idea -- for example, an
encyclopedia -- and make it easy for people to participate in building
it [11]. We will take hold of "learning in institutions" as a map,
although it does not fully conform to our chosen tacitly-familiar
territory of </span><em><span>peeragogy</span></em><span>. To be clear, peeragogy is for </span><em><span>any group of
people who want to learn anything</span></em><span>.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#1" id="fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p><img src="/images/wisconsin-map.jpg" /></p><p><span>Despite thinking about learning and adaptation that may take place far
outside of formal institutions, the historical conception of a
university helps give shape to our inqury. The model university is not
separate from the life of the state or its citizenry, but aims to
"assume leadership in the application of knowledge for the direct
improvement of the life of the people in every sphere" [8]. Research
that </span><em><span>adds to the store of knowledge</span></em><span> is another fundamental obligation
of the university [8]. The university provides a familiar model for
collaborative knowledge work but it is not the only model available.
Considering the role of collaboration in building Wikipedia,
StackExchange, and free/libre/open source software development, we may
be led to ask: What might an accredited free/libre/open university look
like? How would it compare or contrast with the typical or stereotypical
image of a university from the figure above? Would it have similar
structural features, like a Library, Dormitory, Science Hall and so on?
Would participants take on familiar roles [5]? How would it compare with
historical efforts like the Tuskegee Institute that involved students
directly in the production of physical infrastructure [7,19]? We use the
word </span><em><span>peeragogy</span></em><span> to talk about collaboration in relatively
non-hierarchical settings. Examples are found in education, but also in
business, government, volunteer, and NGO settings. Peeragogy involves
both problem solving and problem definition. Indeed, in many cases it is
preferable to focus on solutions, since people know the "problems" all
too well [2]. Participants in a peeragogical endeavor collaboratively
build emergent structures that are responsive to their changing context,
and that in turn, change that context. In the Peeragogy project, we are
developing the the theory and practice of peeragogy.</span></p><p><em><span>Design patterns</span></em><span> offer a methodological framework that we have used to
clarify our focus and organize our work. A design pattern expresses a
commonly-occurring problem, a solution to that problem, and rationale
for choosing this solution [13]. This skeleton is typically fleshed out
with a </span><em><span>pattern template</span></em><span> that includes additional supporting material;
individual patterns are connected with each other in a </span><em><span>pattern
language</span></em><span>. What we present here is rather different from previous
pattern languages that touch on similar topics -- like </span><em><span>Liberating
Voices</span></em><span> [17], </span><em><span>Pedagogical Patterns</span></em><span> [3], and </span><em><span>Learning Patterns</span></em><span> [12].
At the level of the pattern template, our innovation is simply to add a
"What's next" annotation, which anticipates the way the pattern will
continue to "resolve".</span></p><p><span>This addition mirrors the central considerations of our approach, which
is all about human interaction, and the challenges, fluidity and
unpredictability that come with it. Something that works for one person
may not work for another or may not even work for the same person in a
slightly different situation. We need to be ready to clarify and adjust
what we do as we go. Even so, it is hard to argue with a
sensible-sounding formula like "If W applies, do X to get Y." In our
view, other pattern languages often achieve this sort of common sense
rationality, and then stop. Failure in the prescriptive model only
begins when people try to define things more carefully and make
context-specific changes -- when they actually try to put ideas into
practice. The problem lies in the inevitable distance between </span><em><span>do as I
say</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>do as I do</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>do with me</span></em><span> [9]. If people are involved, things
get messy. They may think that they are on the same page, only to find
out that their understandings are wildly different. For example,
everyone may agree that the group needs to go "that way." But how far?
How fast? It is rare for a project to be able to set or even define all
of the parameters accurately and concisely at the beginning. And yet
design becomes a "living language" [1] just insofar as it is linked to
action. Many things have changed since Alexander suggested that "you
will get the most 'power' over the language, and make it your own most
effectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropriate places in
the book" [1]. We see more clearly what it means to inscribe the
changing form of design not just in the margins of a book, or even a
shared wiki, but in the lifeworld itself. Other recent authors on
patterns share similar views [15,16,18].</span></p><p><span>Learning and collaboration are of interest to both organizational
studies and computer science, where researchers are increasingly making
use of social approaches to software design and development, as well as
agent-based models of computation [6,14]. The design pattern community
in particular is very familiar with practices that we think of as
peeragogical, including shepherding, writers workshops, and design
patterns themselves [4,10,13].</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="pattern-template"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Pattern template</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The table below shows the pattern template that we use to present our
patterns. Along with the traditional design patterns components [13],
each of our patterns is fleshed out with two illustrative examples. The
first is descriptive, and looks at how the pattern applies in current
Wikimedia projects. We selected Wikimedia as a source of examples
because the project is familiar, a demonstrated success, and readily
accessible. The second example shows how the pattern could be applied in
the design of a future university. Each pattern concludes with a boxed
annotation: "/What's Next in the Peeragogy Project/".</span></p><table><tr><td><span>Pattern template</span></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><em><span>Motivation</span></em><span> for using this pattern.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Context</span></em><span> of application.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Forces</span></em><span> that operate within the context of application, each with a mnemonic glyph.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Problem</span></em><span> the pattern addresses.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Solution</span></em><span> to the problem.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Rationale</span></em><span> for this solution.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Resolution</span></em><span> of the forces, named in bold.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Example 1</span></em><span>: How the pattern manifests in current Wikimedia projects.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>Example 2</span></em><span>: How the pattern could inform the design of a future university.</span></td></tr><tr><td><em><span>What's Next in the Peeragogy Project</span></em><span>: How the pattern relates to our collective intention in the Peeragogy project</span></td></tr></table></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="a-short-motivating-example"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A short motivating example</span></span></h1><section><p><span>When one relative Newcomer was still in the onboarding process in
Peeragogy project, she hit a wall in understanding the "patterns"
section in the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span> v1. A more seasoned peer invited her
to a series of separate discussions with their own Heartbeat to flesh
out the patterns and make them more accessible. At that time the list of
patterns was simply a list of paragraphs describing recurrent trends.
During those sessions, the impact and meaning of patterns captured her
imagination. She went on to become the champion for the pattern language
and its application in the Peeragogy project. During a "hive editing"
session, she proposed the template we initially used to give structure
to the patterns. She helped further revise the pattern language for the</span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span> v3, and attended PLoP 2015. While a new domain can
easily be overwhelming, this newcomer found A specific project to start
with, and scaffolded her knowledge and contributions from that
foundation.</span></p><p><img src="/images/pattern-connections.png" /></p><table><tr><td><span>overview of problems and solutions in the pattern catalog</span></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td><span>1.
