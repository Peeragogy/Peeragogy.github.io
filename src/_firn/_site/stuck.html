strength".</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Nancy Darling</span></strong><span>: When we need a big favor or social or instrumental
  support, we ask our friends. We call them when we need to move a
  washing machine. But if we need information that we don't have, the
  people to ask are our weak ties. They have more diverse knowledge and
  more diverse ties than our close friends do. We ask them when we want
  to know who to hire to install our washing machine. [1]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The question is less to do with whether we are forming weak ties or
strong ties. We can be "peers" in either a weak or a strong sense. The
question to ask is whether our needs match our expectations!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="problem:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Problem:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>In the peeragogy context, this has to do with how we interact.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>One of us</span></strong><span>: I am learning about peeragogy, but I think I'm failing to
  be a good peeragogue. I remember that Howard once told us that the
  most important thing is that you should be responsible not only for
  your own learning but for your peers' learning. [...] So the question
  is, are we learning from others by ourselves or are we helping others
  to learn?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>If we are "only" co-consumers of information then this seems like a
classic example of a weak tie. We are part of the an "audience".</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="(bogus)-solution:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>(Bogus) Solution:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Perhaps especially in an online, mediated, context, it is possible to

for strong ties. In this case of deep learning, our aims are neither
instrumental nor informational, but "interactional". Incidentally, the
"One of us" quoted above has been one of the most consistently engaged
peeragogues over the years of the project. Showing up is a good step --
you can always help someone else move their washing machine!</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="reference:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Reference:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Nancy Darling (2010).</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/thinking-about-kids/201005/facebook-and-the-strength-weak-ties" target="_blank">Facebook
