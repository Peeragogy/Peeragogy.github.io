incomplete, understanding of the space they are working in, and to
nurture relationships with one another and the other elements of this
space. At the outset, there may not even be a coherent vision for a
project -- but a only loose collection of motivations and sentiments.
Once the project is up and running, people are likely to pull in
different directions.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Building a guide to the goals, activities, experiments and working
methods can help </span><a class="firn-internal" href="http://localhost:4000/newcomer">Newcomers</a><span> and old-timers alike understand their
relationship with the project. It may combine features of a manifesto, a
syllabus, and an issue tracker. It may be a design pattern or a pattern
language [3]. The distinguishing qualities of a project Roadmap are that
it should be adaptive to circumstances, and that it should ultimately
get us from </span><em><span>here</span></em><span> to </span><em><span>there</span></em><span>. By this same token, any given version of
the roadmap is seen as fallible. In lieu of widespread participation,
the project's </span><a class="firn-internal" href="http://localhost:4000/wrapper">Wrapper</a><span> should attempt to synthesize an accurate roadmap
that is informed by participants' behavior, and should help moderate in
case of conflict. Nevertheless, full consensus is not necessary:
different goals, with different </span><em><span>heres</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>theres</span></em><span>, can be pursued
separately, while maintaining communication.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The group evolves from a less-sophisticated to a more-sophisticated
manner of operating by using the roadmap. Using the roadmap builds a
collective awareness of how things are working in practice. In the
Peeragogy project our initial roadmap was a "crowdsourced" outline of
the first edition of the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span>. Later, it took the form
of a schedule of meetings following a regular </span><a class="firn-internal" href="http://localhost:4000/heartbeat">Heartbeat</a><span>, supplemented by
a list of upcoming deadlines. Most recently, our roadmap is expressed in
the emergent objectives collected at the end of current paper. We have
seen that a list of nice-to-have features created in a top-down fashion
is comparatively unlikely to go anywhere! A backlog of tasks and a
realistic plan for accomplishing them are vastly different things. An
adaptive roadmap is an antidote to Tunnel Vision [1].</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="resolution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Resolution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>An emergent roadmap is rooted in real problems and justifiable
solutions-in-progress in all their </span><strong><span>variety</span></strong><span> and communicates both
resolution and follow-through. The process of meshing varied issues with
one another requires thought and discussion, and this encourages</span><strong><span>clarity</span></strong><span>. The test of </span><strong><span>coherence</span></strong><span> is that contributed goals and ideas
should be actionable. The ultimate quality-control test is if it worked,
i.e., did it come to pass that the task(s) the roadmap was created to
achieve ended up being achieved? If all of the issues that the roadmap
outlines are not resolved, the roadmap itself should be revised. Without
a roadmap, we would never know.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="example-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example 1</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The </span><em><span>Help</span></em><span> link present on every Wikipedia page could be seen as a
