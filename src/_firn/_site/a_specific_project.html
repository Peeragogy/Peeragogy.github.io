achieve, you move from thinking about a topic to becoming a
practitioner. You may realize that your "specific project" is too large
to tackle directly. In this case, you will have to become even more
specific.  Maintaining a project </span><a class="firn-internal" href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a><span> can help keep track of the
smaller pieces and the bigger picture.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Being specific is important for bringing about change.</span><a class="firn-footnote-ref" href="#2" id="fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a><span> But while

       while others want to see results. Some others are in the middle.
       All of these variations are OK! However, we are often blinded by
       our own preferences, and in the worst case this can undermine or
       destroy group dynamics. At the very least it will add tension, as
       some want to continue to discuss and engage generally while
       others want to move forward. When the forward-movers try to act,
       those enjoying the experience may attempt to shut them down or
       may feel that they are being left out/behind.</span></p><span class="firn-footnote-def"><span id="2" style="padding-right: 8px">2</span><span><p><span> In the January, 2013, plenary session,</span></p></span><a href="#fn-2" style="padding-left: 4px">↩</a></span><p><span>       </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://ipne.org" target="_blank">Independent Publishers of New England</a><span> (IPNE)
       President Tordis Isselhardt quietly listened to a presentation
       about how we created the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span>. During the Q&A,
       she spoke up, wondering if peer-learning effort in IPNE might be
       more likely to succeed if the organization's members "focused
       around a specific project." As this lightbulb illuminated the
       room, those of us attending the plenary session suggested that
       IPNE could focus the project by creating an "Independent
       Publishing Handbook." (Applause!) In the course of creating the
       IPNE Handbook, peer learners would assemble resource
       repositories, exchange expertise, and collaboratively edit
       documents. To provide motivation and incentive to participate in
       "PeerPubU", members of the association will earn authorship
       credit for contributing articles, editor credit for working on
       the manuscript, and can spin off their own chapters as
       stand-alone, profit-making publications.</span></p><span class="firn-footnote-def"><span id="3" style="padding-right: 8px">3</span><span><p><span> We've found that writing papers for conferences is one activity</span></p></span><a href="#fn-3" style="padding-left: 4px">↩</a></span><p><span>       that can help us focus and make improvements to our body of work
       that would not come about by simply meandering through revisions
       to the </span><em><span>Peeragogy Handbook</span></em><span>. Remixing these efforts into the
       handbook is a good source of improvements; see </span><strong><span>Use or Make</span></strong><span>.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
