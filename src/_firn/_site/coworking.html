  things out there and ask people to help. That's not how it works. You
  make it public, and then you assume that you'll have to do all the
  work, and ask people to come up with suggestions of what you should
  do, not what they should do. Maybe they'll start helping eventually,
  but you should start off with the assumption that you're going to be
  the one maintaining it and ready to do all the work. The other
  thing--and it's kind of related--that people seem to get wrong is to
  think that the code they write is what matters. No, even if you wrote
  100% of the code, and even if you are the best programmer in the world
  and will never need any help with the project at all, the thing that
  really matters is the users of the code. The code itself is
  unimportant; the project is only as useful as people actually find it.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In fact, we can think of contributors as a special class of "user" with
a real time investment in the way the project works. We typically cannot
"Tom Sawyer" ourselves into leisure or ease just because we manage to
work collaboratively, or just because we have found people with some
common interests.  And yet, in the right setting, many people do want to
contribute! For example, on "Wikipedia, the encyclopedia anyone can
edit" (as of
2011) </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://%20http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/wikipedias_goal_1_billion_monthly_visitors_by_2015.php" target="_blank">as
many as</a><span> 80,000 visitors make 5 or more edits per month. This is
interesting to compare with the</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia" target="_blank">empirical fact</a><span>
that (as of 2006) "over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the
users... </span><em><span>24 people</span></em><span>... and in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400
people, have done 73.4% of all the edits."  Similar numbers apply to
other peer production communities.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="a-little-theory"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>A little theory</span></span></h1><section><p><span>In many natural systems, things are not distributed equally, and it is
not atypical for e.g. 20% of the population to control 80% of the wealth
(or, as we saw, for 2% of the users to do nearly 80% of the edits).
Many, many systems work like this, so maybe there's a good reason for
it. Let's think about it in terms of "coordination" as understood by the
late Elinor Ostrom. She talked about "local solutions for local
problems". By definition, such geographically-based coordination
requires close proximity. What does "close" mean? If we think about
homogeneous space, it just means that we draw a circle (or sphere)
around where we are, and the radius of this circle (resp. sphere) is
small.</span></p><p><span>An interesting</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere#Volume_and_surface_area" target="_blank">mathematical
fact</a><span> is that as the dimension grows, the volume of the sphere gets
"thinner", so the radius must increase to capture the same</span><em><span>d</span></em><span>-dimensional volume when </span><em><span>d</span></em><span> grows!  In other words, the more
different factors impact on a given issue, the less likely there are to
be small scale, self-contained, "local problems" or "local solutions" in
the first place.</span></p><p><span>As a network or service provider grows  (like a</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/organize/connectivism-in-practice-how-to-organize-a-mooc/" target="_blank">MOOC</a><span>
as opposed to a</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/case-study-collaborative-explorations/" target="_blank">Collaborative
Exploration</a><span>, for example), they typically build many weak ties, with a
few strong ties that hold it all together.  Google is happy to serve
everyone's web requests -- but they can't have just anyone walking in
off the street and connecting devices their network in Mountain View.</span></p><p><span>By the way, the 2006 article about Wikipedia quoted above was written by
Aaron Swartz ("over 50% of all the edits are done by... 24 people",
etc.), who achieved considerable</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/swartz-arrest/" target="_blank">notoriety</a><span>
for downloading lots and lots of academic papers with a device plugged
into MIT's network. His suicide while under federal prosecution for this
activity caused considerable shock, grief, and dismay among online
activists. One thing we could potentially take away from the experience
is that there is a tremendous difference between a solo effort and the
distributed peer-to-peer infrastructures like the ones that underly the
PirateBay, which, despite raids, fines, jail sentences, nation-wide
bans, and server downtime, has proved decidedly hard to extinguish.
According to a recent press release: "If they cut off one head, two more
shall take its place."</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="co-working:-what-is-an-institution?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Co-working: what is an institution?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>As idealists, we would love to be able to create systems that are both
powerful and humane.  Some may reflect with a type of sentimental
fondness on completely mythical economic systems in which a "dedicated
individual could rise to the top through dint of effort."  But
well-articulated systems like this </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> exist: natural languages, for
example, are so expressive and adaptive that most sentences have never
been said before.  A well-articulated system lends itself to "local
solutions to local problems" -- but in the linguistics case, this is
only because all words are not created equal.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Dr Seuss</span></strong><span>: My brothers read a little bit. Little words like 'If' and
  'It.' My father can read big words, too, Like CONSTANTINOPLE and
  TIMBUKTU.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>We could go on here to talk about Coase's theory of the firm, and
Benkler's theory of
"</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf" target="_blank">Coase's Penguin</a><span>". We
might continue</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/perfectinstitutions" target="_blank">quoting</a><span> from
Aaron Swartz. But we will not get so deeply into that here: you can
explore it on your own!  For now, it is enough to say that an
institution is a bit like a language.  This will help us a lot in the
next section.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="designing-a-platform-for-peer-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Designing a platform for peer learning</span></span></h1><section><blockquote><p><span>  </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://planetmath.org" target="_blank">PlanetMath</a><span> </span><em><span>is a virtual community which
  aims to help make mathematical knowledge more accessible.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>In my PhD thesis [1], I talk about my work to turn this long-running
website, which since 2001 had focused on building a mathematics
encyclopedia, into a peer produced peer learning environment. We wanted
to retain all of the old activities related to authoring, reviewing, and
discussing encyclopedia articles, but we would also add a bunch of new
features having to do with mathmatical problem solving, an activity that
is suitable for mathematical beginners.</span></p><p><span>My first translation of this idea into a basic interaction design was as
follows.  People can continue to add articles to PlanetMath's
encyclopedia: they can connect one article to another (A$\rightarrow$A)
either by making one article the "parent" of another, or, more
typically, via an inline link. Like in the old system, users can discuss
any object (X$\rightarrow$T), but now there is more structure:</span><em><span>problems</span></em><span> can be connected to articles (A$\rightarrow$P) and</span><em><span>solutions</span></em><span> can be connected to problems (P$\rightarrow$S).  Instead of
explicitly modeling "goals," I decided that problems and articles could
be organized into "collections," the same way that videos are organized
into playlists on YouTube, and that the user would get encouraging
directed feedback as they work their way through the problems in a given
collection.  I described a few other types of objects and interactions,
like questions and answers, groups, and the ability to change the "type"
of certain contributed objects.</span></p><p><span>The next step was to do a complete overhaul of PlanetMath's software
system, to build something that could actually /do/ all of that.  After
deploying the realized system and doing some studies with PlanetMath
users, I realized the design summarized above was not complete.  Note
that this is very much along the lines of what Linus Torvalds said
above: I did the design, and me and a small group of collaborators with
their own vested interests built the system, then we put it out there to
get more ideas from users.</span></p><p><span>The main thing that was missing from the earlier design was the idea of
a </span><em><span>project</span></em><span>.  From interviewing users, it became clear to me that it
would be helpful to think of every object as being part of at least one
project: everything should have someone looking after it!   Importantly,
getting back to the very beginning of this article, each project can
define its own purpose for existing.  Here's how I put it in my thesis:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  /Actions and artifacts are embedded within projects, which can be
  modeled in terms of informal user experience and formal system
  features. Project updates can be modeled with a language of
  fundamental actions. Projects themselves model their outcomes, and are
  made "viable" by features that connect to the motivations and
  ambitions of potential participants./</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The key point is that the evolving design describes a sort "grammar" for
the kinds of things that can be done on PlanetMath.  In the updated
design, projects are something like paragraphs that combine simple
sentences.  The language can be extended further, and I hope that will
happen in further study.  In particular, we need to understand more
about how the "sub-language" of project updates works (compare
the </span><a class="firn-external" href="http://peeragogy.org/practice/roadmap/" target="_blank">Roadmap</a><span> pattern
described in this handbook).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="the-discussion-continues:-reliving-the-history-of-mathematics-as-a"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>The discussion continues: Reliving the history of mathematics as a</span></span></h1><section><p><span>peeragogical game?</span></p><p><span>These notes have shown one approach to the design of spaces for learning
and knowledge building. Although the article has focused on mathematics
learning, similar reflections would apply to designing other sorts of

development of the Peeragogy project itself! Perhaps it can contribute
to the development of a new kind of institution.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Doug Breitbart</span></strong><span>: It occurred to me that you could add a learning

  problems, proofs and theorems that, although already solved, could be
  re-cast as if not yet solved, and framed as current challenges which
  visitors could take on (clearly with links to the actual solutions,
  and deconstruction of how they were arrived at, when the visitor
