This pattern can help project participants recognize and communicate
their stresses to make themselves and the project more resilient.

One of the important maxims from the world of FLOSS is: "Given enough
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" [8]. A partial converse is also true:
there's only so much any one person can do, since we all have limited
time and energy.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[file:images/antifragility.png]] *Antifragility*: each person's
  potential can only be realized if people take on enough, but not too
  much.

  [[file:images/independence.png]] *Independence*: in a peeragogy
  context, it is often impossible to delegate work to others.

* Problem
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: problem
    :END:

How can we help prevent those people who are involved with the project
from over-promising or over-committing, and subsequently crashing and
burning? First, let's be clear that there are lots of ways things can go
wrong. Simplistic expectations -- like /assuming that others will do the
work for you/ [13] -- can undermine your ability to correctly gauge your
own strengths, weaknesses, and commitments. Without careful, critical
engagement, you might not even notice when there's a problem. Where one
person has trouble letting go, others may have trouble speaking up.
Pressure builds when communication isn't going well.

* Solution
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: solution
    :END:

Serious frustration is a sign that it's time to revisit the group's and
your own individual plan. Are these realistic? If you have a "buddy"
they can provide a reality check. Maybe things are not /that hard/ after
all -- and maybe they don't need to be done /right now/. Generalizing
from this: the project can promote an open dialog by creating
opportunities for people to share their worries and generate an emergent
plan for addressing them [10]. Use the project to make note of
obstacles. For example, if you'd like to pass a baton, you'll need
someone there who can take it. Maybe you can't find that person right
away, but you can bring up the concern and get it onto the project's .
The situation is always changing, but if we continue to create suitable
checkpoints and benchmarks, then we can take steps to take care of an
issue that's getting bogged down.

* Rationale
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: rationale
    :END:

Think of the project as an ecosystem populated by acts of participation.
As we get to know more about ourselves and each other, we know what
sorts of things we can expect, and we are able to work together more
sustainably [6]. We moderate stress and improve collective outcomes by
taking concerns seriously.

* Resolution
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: resolution
    :END:

Guiding and rebalancing behavior in a social context can begin with
speaking up about a concern. When we acknowledge concerns, we must take
into account our own boundedness. We have find an opportunity to make
ourselves helpful, without impinging on others' *independence*. This
doesn't mean allowing all possible stresses to run rampant: we work to
stay within the realm of *antifragility*, where manageable stress
/improves/ the system rather than degrading it [12]. As we share
concerns and are met with care and practical support, our actions begin
to align better with expectations (often as a result of forming more
realistic expectations).

* Example 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: example-1
    :END:

Wikipedia aims to emphasize a neutral point of view, but its users are
not neutral.[fn:1] topics that matter to them.[fn:2] and participation
are not neutral in another less sanguine sense. More information on
Wikipedia deals with Europe than all of the locations outside of Europe
[2]. As we remarked in the pattern, most of the actual work is
contributed by a small percentage of users. The technology limits the
kinds of things that can be said [2]. The total number of active editors
has been falling since 2007.[fn:3] Some blame outmoded technology and an
insider culture [11], or a stringent editorial approach that emerged in
response to the site's popularity [3]. Others highlight the rise of
successful competition, often inspired by wiki models, but driven by
"corporate logic" [4,5]. Some proposed solutions focus on various
indicators of "community health."[fn:4]

* Example 2

Progressive thinkers have for some time subscribed to the view that
"there shall be no women in case there be not men, nor men in case there
be not women" [7]. A separate Ladies Hall seems entirely archaic.
However, in light of the extreme gender imbalance in free software, and
still striking imbalance at Wikipedia [1,9], it will be important to do
whatever it takes to make women and girls welcome, not least because
this is a significant factor in boosting our .

Making it easy and fruitful for others to get involved is one of the
best ways to redistribute the load. This often requires knowledge
transfer and skill development among those involved; see .
