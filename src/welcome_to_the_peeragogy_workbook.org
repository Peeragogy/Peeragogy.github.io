#+title: ☞ Welcome to the Peeragogy Workbook!
#+FIRN_ORDER: 2

This booklet is designed to introduce you to our fun, exciting world of
peer learning and peer production!! You may already be familiar with
these terms, or they may be new to you. Either way, don't worry!!!

If they are new, consider the following 2 examples.

1. /Peer learning/: Joe Corneli needs to get from the suburbs of Chicago
   to the north side of the city. He gets on the commuter train and
   transfers to the purple "L" at Davis Street in Evanston. He plans to
   change to the red line at Howard Street, but the train says "Loop"
   and he asks another passenger whether it will stop at Howard. She
   says it will, but that he can save an hour of his time by riding
   express to the city and then coming back two stops! Joe makes it to
   his meeting with Charlie with plenty of time to spare.

2. /Peer production/: Two cavewomen see lightning strike a tree and
   produce fire! Walking up to it they notice the heat and think
   "Wouldn't it be nice to have fire for our family at night!" Once the
   rain clears, they find some dry sticks and start working together to
   figure out how they can use them to start their own flame. After
   hours of trial and error, BOOM they've got fire! The news travels
   fast. :)

Peeragogy is an approach to learning and working together on projects
ranging from the mundane to the monumental. Peer learning and peer
production are probably as old as humanity itself, but they take on new
importance in the digital age.

The Peeragogy Project is an informal learning project with members
worldwide. Three members of the project share their welcoming messages
below.

*Paola Ricaurte Quijano*: Welcome to the Peeragogy Project! We are a
group of enthusiastic people who love to learn and are trying to find
the best ways to learn together.

*Lisa Snow MacDonald*: Welcome to peeragogy! It's kind of a weird name,
but it's enormously powerful in providing a fresh understanding of ways
of working together.

*Dorotea Mar*: Your contributions will be really welcome if you
participate respectfully and harmoniously with other peers. It can
change your life and improve your well­being and make everything better.

*Paola Ricaurte Quijano*: Hi! I'm Paola, I'm from Ecuador. I work at
Tecnológico de Monterrey, a private university in Mexico City, and I
love to learn with everybody!

*Dorotea Mar*: Hello. I'm in Berlin now and I really like the
peeragogical atmosphere of collaboration and I think we are really
improving ways of collaboration and peer production, so that's why I'm
here.

*Lisa Snow MacDonald*: Hello. This is Lisa from Los Angeles. My
background is media psychology and I'm interested in peeragogy as it
relates to business.

/What is peer learning/production?/

*PRQ* Well, peer learning. learning with peers, learning from peers and
trying to make things together or make things happen together. I think
that for me, the most important thing I've learned from this experience
is that you can achieve more when you work together and set goals
together.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **LSM** I think peer learning and peer production are unstructured ways
  for people to come together to pool their relative strengths to
  achieve results that might not be achieved if they were working
  individually on their respective sections and then trying to assemble
  them.

  **DM** I'm still trying to find out.  i thought the answer to this
  question was clear to me when I joined the Peeragogy Project and then
  I realized there is so much more to this. When we're learning together
  there are so many other processes happening and they are integral
  processes of learning together. I think the answer is I'm still trying
  to find out.

  **PRQ** Yeah, I think Dorotea is right. I think that the process is the
  goal. And the emotional relationships that you build during the
  process are also important.
  -->
#+END_HTML

*LSM* I think what peeragogy does is it allows us to recognize the value
of those connections. A lot of other ways of working are more
individualized. It goes back to a concept of 1 + 1 = 2, which is very
rational and very measured and is kind of a dominant way of thinking in
our society today, whereas peer to peer learning and production
recognize the value of those connections. You may not be able to measure
it with a yardstick, but we understand that there is value in those
connections. So it's basically acknowledging that when it comes to
learning/collaborative environments if constructed the right way if
working well it can be 1 + 1 = 3 or 1 + 1 = 4. That type of situation,
which is really different from the way we're used to thinking about
things. And I think that's really the value of what we're doing and the
potential of what we could hopefully unlock.

/More specifically, what is peeragogy and/or what is the Peeragogy
Project?/

*PRQ* This is a project that began spontaneously. We didn't have a plan
at the beginning. We just talked about the things that concerned us the
most. What do you need if you want to learn with others, how to learn
better? what do you want to learn? Where do you want to learn? When do
you want to learn? Basic questions that can be answered in many ways. We
don't have a strict line. We have a map, maybe, but a map that can be
walked through by many different paths. Paths that you choose can be
related to the people you are working with. I think it's been a great
experience for us. As Lisa said, we have been recognizing the talents
and strengths of every person that has contributed to and participated
in this project.

*LSM* OK. I'll take my best shot with this. Going back to what I said
earlier and building off what other people have said. Because we don't
have a good mental construct of how this works, and measurement is
difficult. We haven't learned how to measure these connections. I think
what peeragogy and the Peeragogy Project can do is it can establish what
people have said about focusing on the process. It can help people
understand the process better. Because this lack of structure can be
uncomfortable for people. We need to understand when that discomfort is
acceptable, so they don't revert and become counter­productive
participants in the process. The map analogy that Paola just mentioned,
is really good too. It's not about providing a direct path. If you're on
a trip trying to get from LA to Chicago, there's many paths you can
take. It's making sure you're monitoring your resources and you're
taking care of things along the way. You can drift off-course. One plus
one can equal zero if things don't work out well. So, what peeragogy and
the Peeragogy Project can do is to provide some structure and framework
around the unstructured way that things can be done. People trying to
make sure their methods are constructive and beneficial now have some
guidelines and things to watch out for.

** Example: Howard Rheingold Grows a Learning Network
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: example-howard-rheingold-grows-a-learning-network
   :END:

"When I started using social media in the classroom, I looked for and
began to learn from more experienced educators. First, I read and then
tried to comment usefully on their blog posts and tweets. When I began
to understand who knew what in the world of social media in education, I
narrowed my focus to the most knowledgeable and adventurous among them.
I paid attention to the people the savviest social media educators paid
attention to. I added and subtracted voices from my attention network,
listened and followed, then commented and opened conversations. When I
found something I thought would interest the friends and strangers I was
learning from, I passed along my own learning through my blogs and
Twitter stream. I asked questions, asked for help, and eventually
started providing answers and assistance to those who seemed to know
less than I. The teachers I had been learning from had a name for what I
was doing --- “growing a personal learning network." So I started
looking for and learning from people who talked about HOW to grow a
"PLN" as the enthusiasts called them.”

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **DM** For me peeragogy is really a great experience. I think the way
  we do things we are going beyond any collaborative project
  basically. We allow so much freedom/openness in the Project. Everyone
  is welcome, basically.  Anyone can just jump in and propose something
  and this will somehow fit in. And this is quite amazing for me. Over
  the last year it will just be really creative.  We don't really have
  any restrictions. People can join from anywhere in the world, like
  today I was cooking and that was OK. So I think that's really nice,
  the atmosphere, the relationships and the mutual respect we have for
  each other and appreciation. This is really important.

  **PRQ**    I think that when we began this we were thinking about a
  new   pedagogy   of   learning   with   others,   so   that's   what
  peeragogy   is,   a   new   way   of   seeing   and   collaborating   and
  learning in open spaces and spaces that are not constrained
  by time or space. It's an open learning environment for people
  that   are   driven   by   self­motivation   of   going   somewhere   with
  some others.

/How do you do peeragogy?/

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **LSM** That's a good question. I've been thinking more about how you
  create a culture of peeragogy.  It can tend to be a natural extension
  of the way in which people behave. If the culture/environment is
  created around a group of people they will tend to participate in that
  way. I'm not sure if you say I wanna do peeragogy I'm not sure how to
  respond to that actually. Except I'd want a loose structure, I'm not
  sure.
  -->
#+END_HTML

*DM* I think I do a lot of peeragogy and I'm very happy about it because
I learn so much from my group and from myself in this group that I like
to apply it to other projects that I'm in or things like co­working and
co­living projects. Especially the principle of mutual respect that
still remains after a very long time. And the way we relate to each
other is really nice.

The main principle is mutual respect and openness, and the process. And
in each detail, there is value that we believe in.

Let's say how we manage the Peeragogy Page or Community (See "How to Get
Involved," later in this chapter.). These seem to be details, but
they're actually really important. So if we pay attention to all these,
every little thing matters, and this is how I do it. I try to be very
mindful in all interactions.

** Example: Learner, know thyself.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: example-learner-know-thyself.
   :END:

When he joined the Peeragogy project in 2012, Charles Jeffrey Danoff did
a brief self­evaluation about what makes him interested in learning:

1. Context. As a student, I resisted being groomed for some
   unforeseeable future. I'd rather work toward a specific goal.

2. Timing and sequence. I find learning fun when I'm studying something
   as a way to procrastinate another pressing assignment.

3. Social reinforcement. Getting tips from peers on how to navigate a
   snowboard around moguls was more fun for me than my Dad showing me
   the proper way to buff the car's leather seats on chore day.

4. Experiential awareness. In high school, it was not fun to sit and
   compose a 30-page reading journal on Frankenstein. But owing in part
   to those types of prior experiences, I now find writing pleasurable
   and it's fun to learn how to write better.

--------------

*PRQ* I think peeragogy is more like a mind­set. I think we have to
change the way we interact with others and the way we understand the
parameters of learning. For example, I'm a teacher and, of course, my
teaching practice promotes collaborative, creative learning. So, I
expect my students to take responsibility for their own learning by
making decisions about most aspects of the learning process; to program
their own learning goals. They need to learn to effectively employ the
environments (like whiteboards), the activities, and the assessments.
I'm trying to give my learners the tools to decide how, what, and why
they want to learn. For me, it's been a very interesting experience.
Learners often find it unfamiliar to make their own decisions about the
process in a formal environment. At the beginning of the semester,
students are given everything and usually just follow guidelines and
criteria. I have been trying to change this dynamic. Students feel
insecure, because they really do not know how or what they want to do.
So, that process of making decisions together becomes very rich and very
meaningful.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **DM** This, for us, was like a workshop so that we also learn how to be
  more peeragogical, and I think we're extending it to all the domains
  of our life. It's almost like we are
  coaching each other in being more collaborative. This is a
  very good thing for us, as well.

  **PRQ** As Lisa said, we are developing this culture of collaboration in different environments and seeing each environment as an opportunity to learn together.

  **DM** I think we're also spreading a culture of collaboration and that is a beautiful experience. This is an
  ongoing experience. We help others to experience this by interacting on project processes and outcomes. 

  The whole process of learning together was also a
  learning process. It helped us to create
  a culture of collaboration and we have transferred
  it to other groups we interact with. 

  **LSM** I think what Dorotea said is important, because we often don't
  have the right language and many words have double meanings. So when
  we look at the concept of a team, it can carry with it different
  meanings. One can be disjointed approach where everyone has specific,
  different roles or there are other concepts of team where everyone is
  integrated and working together. And yet a lot of times those
  differences aren't communicated directly when you're working with
  groups. So we're bringing to the surface things that are often
  implicit when they're working in groups and by pulling it to the
  surface we're raising awareness that people are making choices and
  there are these different choices in how we approach things. 

  Where do you do peeragogy?

  **DM** Everywhere I can. Even in the kitchen, cooking with a
  friend, I am doing peeragogy.

  **LSM** I think you can do it just about anywhere. My interest though
  is as it relates to business. How different groups and departments
  work together.

  **PRQ** I agree with Dorotea. I try to "peeragogy" everywhere. We should create 
  a verb for that! I collaborate w/a group of human rights activists in 
  Contingentemx (http://contingentemx.net/) and I also see my
  interactions there as a peeragogical practice. When you are in a
  family you should understand you are a team, and if you see
  every member as a valuable contributor to the common goals of that
  team, it works much better.

--------------

/When do you do peeragogy?/

*DM* I think I'm always practicing it. I really like that during the
weekly hangouts we don't usually have rigid agendas. We just get
creative and let ideas connect and flow. And whatever happens it's the
right thing. We just work together and somehow the right things happen.
I think we're always doing peeragogy when we pursue activities and
projects in open, collaborative ways without imposing too much structure
or heirarchy.

*PRQ* I agree with Dorotea. The where and when questions are related. If
you're thinking about where, you're thinking about when. So if "where"
is everywhere, and "when" is always, I agree. Anywhere, everywhere, all
the time. It's an ongoing process. If you believe in peeragogy as a way
of doing things or making things happen, you cannot switch back and
forth betweeen two different personas and say, "I'm not working with
peeragogy now," or "I am applying peeragogy now."

*LSM* I'm familiar with the business world where there are distinct
personalities. For example there are people who tend to be more
collaborative just by nature, who tend to adapt and to prefer a
peeragogical model. Other personalities are less so, and that's why what
we're doing here is valuable. In practice, there's seldom a conscious
recognition of these different styles of working. In a business
environment, there are different motivators, different personalities
tossed together, all united by a single goal. So understanding
peeragogical vs. heirarchical practices, and raising the differences to
the surface, could be very valuable in pursuing the goal of making
people's lives better in the business environment.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **DM** To pick up on what Paola said about the process.  Sometimes we
  like to imagine that Peeragogy is just that, a simple process, but then we
  realize that it's actually something more.
  It means more and more each time we refer to
  it. It's an evolving process, a continually evolving construct. The more we practice it, the better we
  understand it and the broader we view the entire landscape around it.
  What really matters is how we practice this process. Our learning and increasing understanding of what it really is are both part of the process itself.   It is a notion that evolves through our exploration of it. 

  **PRQ** Yeah, I agree with Dorotea in the sense that it's a dynamic,
  on­going process.  It's very important to be aware of the metacognition
  involved. We are always reflecting on just what we are doing and how we are going about it.
  How do we want do this? What do we want?  Why? Are we doing the right
  thing? It's a long process as we're always asking ourselves
  questions but that is just part of the learning
  process. As a result, we become increasingly aware of just what should be promoted
  and what might be better left alone.  Who does peeragogy?

  **PRQ** Of course, we consider ourselves to be a peeragogy team. Not
  everybody is familiar with our, let's say, strategies and beliefs. If we are thinking, feeling, creating ways to solve problems peeragogically, then this is a useful structure to apply to a variety of environments.
  It becomes difficult when others try to impose rules or define things without considering our
  ideas or input. Lisa was talking about organizations. Peeragological principles, applied to entrepreneurial environments/contexts could be highly effective in increasing the power of the given missions. 

  **LSM** I think a lot of people working in business environments are unaware of the peeragogical principles they use daily.
   I think we all are to some extent. Digital activities like surfing around
   social media, googling, or going into
  chatrooms can be a kind of peeragogy (of peer to peer to peer support):
  a way of solving a particular problem.  I think everybody does it
  on different levels, but they may not be aware of it.
  -->
#+END_HTML

*DM* There are many collaborative projects that aim to do something
similar to this, but, in a sense, focus on different aspects of the
process, and maybe not on such an abstract level as we might.

Some people have natural peeragogical tendencies, and some people are
less transparent in the way they do things. For me, peeragogy is really
beneficial, especially for collaborative projects. Everybody works and
learns differently, so if everyone became increasingly aware of how they
and others work and learn, of how peergogy functions, and how it all
fits into a bigger picture, many tasks would not only be more
efficiently done, but also much more enjoyable. It's also beneficial if
everyone focusses on a bigger picture instead of focussing only on their
part of it, and if attention is drawn to all that could be done in a
peeragogical way.

"If I were an instructional designer in a moribund training department,
I'd polish up my resume and head over to marketing. Co­learning can
differentiate services, increase product usage, strengthen customer
relationships, and reduce the cost of hand­holding. It's cheaper and
more useful than advertising. But instead of just making a copy of
today's boring educational practices, build something based on
interaction and camaraderie, perhaps with some healthy competition
thrown in. Again, the emphasis should always be on learning in order to
do something!"

--------------

/Why do you do peeragogy?/

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **DM**       Because it feels really nice. It helps a lot with relating to
  others and evolving the relationships we share in projects and, well, 
  basically everywhere. It's a very healthy way of doing things
  and it makes us feel good, makes others feel good. I think it's a
  good thing in general.
  -->
#+END_HTML

*PRQ* Why? Well, as said before, I believe in peeragogy. I believe it's
a good way to learn. Maybe it's the best way. I think I wasn't aware of
that before joining the group. I have always been a self­learner, I have
been working mostly alone. After I began working with the group, I
understood that you grow working with a group. You achieve things that
you aren't able to achieve alone. I think there's a growing awareness of
the value of collaboration in every setting and environment. There are
more and more learning communities around the world where people are
also learning that making decisions together and working together are
the best way to be in this world! I think as we live through hard times,
we increasingly need a sense that we are not alone and that we cannot
solve problems alone.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <!--
  **LSM**       My interest in peeragogy goes back to an experience in
  business where I saw the potential benefits of peeragogy in an organization
  being   stripped   away   as   new executives  (who didn't   understand   what   they   were
  stripping away) came   in. I enjoy it, I see the benefits because I've experienced it and I've
  seen how corrosive other ways of thinking can be to the well
  being of both employees and corporations.

#+END_HTML

/How did you join the Peeragogy project?/

*PRQ* After taking Howard Rheingold's course on Mind Amplifiers in 2012
we were invited to join this group. There was no plan, just an open
question of how to best learn with others.\\
That's how it began. We had lots of sessions and discussed a wide range
of issues. The Peeragogy Handbook (http://peeragogy.org) was the product
of that process. We've been working with the Handbook, releasing a new
version every year and trying to figure out what might be the best way
to go forward and what the future of our collaboration as a group/team
might be.

*LSM* A couple friends of mine were involved in P2P learning. They were
invited to a conference at UCI. Howard was at the event and they were
familiar with him and his work. We ended up in an obscure classroom and
he started talking about principles that were peeragogy related, while I
don't know if it provided much value to my friends, it sounded a lot
like what I saw in business and he mentioned the group. So after that, I
met everyone here and it's been pretty random.

*DM* I think many paths led to my involvement. I have a lot of academic
experience and was doing research on Open Science. I had always wanted
to improve the way things work and somehow I wanted to do it more
creatively. I resonated a lot with the Peeragogy Project on many levels,
so somehow I just joined, I think it was serendipity of some kind.

This interview was conducted on December 15th, 2014. The transcript was
edited. You can watch the whole interview online at
