* Welcome to the Peeragogy Handbook.

** About

The Peeragogy project was convened by Howard Rheingold in 2012
([[https://clalliance.org/blog/toward-peeragogy/][https://clalliance.org/blog/toward-peeragogy/]]). If you have a
couple minutes to listen to Howard tell the story, here is a video in
which he describes how he went from organising co-teaching in his
classes at Berkeley and Stanford, to running collaborative courses
online, to convening a group of people to collect practical know-how
about how to learn any subject *without* teachers: [[https://youtu.be/dHvGIX2Wjss?t=138][https://youtu.be/dHvGIX2Wjss?t=138]]

The Peeragogy Handbook collects the results of our investigations. In
capsule form, peeragogy centres on the process of learning together and
making that learning available to others. We decided to early on to
publish our book directly in to the public domain, via the CC Zero
waiver, so that we could minimise friction for people adopting and
adapting the contents ([[http://www.peeragogy.org/license][http://www.peeragogy.org/license]]). We are
currently working on the 4th Edition of the book, which will bring a lot
of changes to the contents (the 3rd Edition was published in 2016).
