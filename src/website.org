#+title: Website
#+roam_tags: SUB

Our main website is =peeragogy.org= — but because the contents are
public domain, anyone has the right to make their own website, and we
also have a bunch of different things spread out in different areas.

The website itself (and all the other online bits and pieces) could be
better maintained.

* Next steps

- For now “website” is [[https://peeragogy.org/tags][one of the tags]] used on peeragogy.org, but it should probably develop into its own pattern.
