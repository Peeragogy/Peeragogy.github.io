#+title: Course

One of the reasons for writing the [[file:peeragogy_handbook_v4.org][Peeragogy Handbook v4]] is that we
didn’t think that the predecessor was actually sufficiently used (or
sufficiently useful, if we’re honest). We included a short syllabus we
called [[file:action.org][Peeragogy in action]], but it didn’t seem to catch on.  So we
figured we should deliver a course about Peeragogy ourselves
somewhere, using the /Handbook/ as the course text.  At first we were
looking around for the right venue, but we also figured we could just
pilot the course ourselves any time.  So we’ve been working on that.

* Next steps

- For now “course” is [[https://peeragogy.org/tags][one of the tags]] used on peeragogy.org, but it should probably develop into its own pattern.
