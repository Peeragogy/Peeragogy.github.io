The Peeragogy project is an example of [[file:specific.org][A specific project]].  To sum up what we do:

#+begin_quote
“Finding tools to facilitate peer production & peer learning experiences”
#+end_quote

We think that people who are interested in our work may be in two main tracks:
- People who want to build their own ‘peeragogy projects’, and:
- People who just want to improve the way they work

One of the challenges is to identify why we are doing a next edition
(and maybe another edition after that).  We should have a clear
understanding about what worked and did not work in the previous
versions, and why, so we know what to revise, why we are revising it
and it can lead to informed discussions about how.

This itself is work in progress.

* Next steps

- For now “project” is [[https://peeragogy.org/tags][one of the tags]] used on peeragogy.org, but it should probably develop into its own pattern.
