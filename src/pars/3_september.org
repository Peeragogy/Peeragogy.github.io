* Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

We expected to continue making progress on our paper for the special
issue of the Futures Journal.

* Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?

We added some ideas throughout the paper, especially the conclusion
where we focused on trying out Schwarz's "Steps to Developing
Scenarios" with the future of English language learning as an example

* What are some different perspectives on whatâ€™s happening?

I was excited at to see the paper improve!

* What did we learn or change?

We learned there are some exciting new directions for the paper to go!

* What else should we change going forward?

I think we should try to find a time soon when all the authors of the
paper can join.
