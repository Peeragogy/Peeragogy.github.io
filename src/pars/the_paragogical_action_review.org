* 1
We facilitate an online workshop on “Paragogy and Ubuntu.” It doesn’t go well. We want to understand why.
* 2
Participants have trouble installing open source software Mumble. There is little activity on the shared Etherpad.
* 3
We discuss trade-offs between community and individual projects. Conference organizers suggest a “good outcome” is just increased awareness of paragogy. 
* 4
We strengthen our shared skills at working with risk by devising the PAR.
* 5
We hope to establish a distributed “mutual aid society”—but we need to work harder to make sure that it’s really mutual.
