N/A
* Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?
• We made some progress on editing the handbook
• There was a small, but mighty group of people going through the course and it went well!
* What are some different perspectives on what’s happening?
• The regular meeting times we found in January 14 have been invaluable
in terms of keeping us moving and giving our work a heartbeat 15
• Like a television show pilot 16 the course still has some kinks to work out,
but it is looking very promising for the future
* What did we learn or change?
• Running an online online course on peeragogy is fun
• Floobits 17 is a nice online tool for editing the handbook that connects
directly to GitHub, although it is not the most user friendly for everyone
* What else should we change going forward?
• Keep improving how we learn and produce things collaboratively!
