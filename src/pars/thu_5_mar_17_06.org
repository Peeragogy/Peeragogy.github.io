* Review the intention: what do we expect to learn or make together?

We wanted to keep learning peeragogy as part of the course

Wanted to work on paper

* Establish what is happening: what and how are we learning?

We talked about the paper, our successes and failures and causal layered analysis
Took lots of good notes on the Google doc

* What are some different perspectives on whatâ€™s happening?

I felt like it was a productive session!

* What did we learn or change?

Changed the paper
Learned about CLA

* What else should we change going forward?

Incorporate all the comments and ideas into the next version of the paper

Also some of us need to do our homework before the next class on Thursday the 12th (including me!)
