Next: [[file:wrap_march.org][Wrap March]]
* 1
We prepare a submission for the 2018 Connected Learning Summit.
* 2
We have a dialogue about the “what’s next” steps from our pattern catalogue, asking what makes the Peeragogy project a sustainable learning community.
* 3
At the last minute, we realize we need to anonymize the paper. The content is too much about “us” to stand up well to those changes.
* 4
We subsequently revise the text into a successful submission for Anticipation 2019.
* 5
We review work that was accepted for CLS
