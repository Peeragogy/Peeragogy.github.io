* 1
We want to run a MOOC to codesign a peeragogy-based university: peeragogy.edu.
* 2
We develop an outline syllabus and budget, and pitch to the Knight Foundation.
* 3
The details of the syllabus are meant to be worked out with students when they arrive, which is somewhat confusing; the tasks and budget are more concrete.
* 4
We have a budget breakdown for $50,000.
* 5
We should rework the syllabus around the target audienceâ€”possibly in a classroom rather than a MOOC.
