#+TITLE: Quickstart Guide

* Summary

Active subprojects of the Peeragogy project include work on this
[[file:website.org][Website]], the [[file:project.org][Project]] as a whole, a [[file:course.org][Course]], our [[file:podcast.org][Podcast]], some [[file:paper.org][Papers]],
[[file:community.org][Community]] stuff, and the 4th edition of the [[file:handbook.org][Peeragogy Handbook]].  This
work is designed to help surface useful ideas and techniques you can
apply in your own projects.

* 250 word overview: how you can get involved

- *Book.* The [[https://peeragogy.org/][Peeragogy Handbook]] can help any group of people learn or
  create something together. You can read it online or download it for
  free, or buy a paper copy: or join us to help write the 4th Edition.
- *Podcast.* The Peeragogy in Action Podcast is available on all the
  major podcast providers, with videos available on YouTube.
- *Mailing Lists.* Our main public discussions are on Google Groups.  We
  also have a second mailing list that is focused on revisions to the
  Peeragogy Handbook.
- *Live Meetings.* Public meetings appear on our public calendar:
  currently, we’re meeting regularly at 9AM Eastern on Thursdays, with
  other meetings as needed.
- *Annotations.* To comment on peeragogy.org, please make an account at
  Hypothesis, and use the mini-toolbar on the right-hand side of each
  page.
- *Source code.* The Handbook content is archived on Github Pages.
- *Contributed text.* /Handbook/ editors are happy to work with relevant
  submissions in any format. Contact us and help you get the material
  ready.
- *Projects.* We’re currently managing subprojects inside the /Handbook/
  itself, using Emacs and Org Mode.  We made a written guide for
  newcomers — but if you’re new to these tools it might be better to
  drop a line and ask one of us for a quick tutorial.
- *More details.* Please have a look at this [[https://github.com/Peeragogy/peeragogy-handbook/wiki/Quickstart-guide][longer quickstart guide]] for
  more information about our tools and workflow, and more ways to get
  involved.
