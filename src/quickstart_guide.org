#+TITLE: Quickstart Guide

- *Book* :: This book can help any group of people learn or create
  something together. You can read it online or download it with zero
  cost, or buy a paper copy, or fork a copy of your own to work on.
- *Podcast* :: The Peeragogy Podcast is available on multiple sites:
  Videos are available on YouTube.[fn:1]
- *Mailing List* :: Our main public discussions are on Google Groups
  Sign up there to get email and post to the wider contributor
  community.[fn:2] Remember to ask questions!  We also have a second
  mailing list that is focused on revisions to the Peeragogy Handbook.
  It is hosted by the OSU Open Source Lab.[fn:3]
- *Live Meetings* :: Public meetings appear on our public calendar.[fn:4]
  You subscribe for updates via Google Calendar.[fn:5]
  You can also subscribe with other software that reads the =.ics= format.[fn:6]
- *Annotations* :: To comment on the Peeragogy Handbook please make an
  account at Hypothesis.[fn:7] Then you can use the mini-toolbar on
  the right-hand side of each page on peeragogy.org.  Comments from
  across the site are available.[fn:8] You're also welcome to share
  reviews or comments elsewhere of course!
- *Organization* :: We’ve managed many of our projects through a Github "organization".[fn:9]
  The master copy of the Handbook content is on Github Pages.[fn:10]
  Pull requests are welcome, but /Handbook/ editors are happy to take submissions in other formats as well.
- *Projects* :: We’re currently managing subprojects inside the /Handbook/
  itself using Emacs and Org Mode.  We made a written guide for
  newcomers, but if you’re new to these tools it might be better just
  to ask one of us.
- *More details* :: Please have a look at this [[https://github.com/Peeragogy/peeragogy-handbook/wiki/Quickstart-guide][longer quickstart guide]]
  for more information about our tools and workflow, and more ways to
  get involved.
