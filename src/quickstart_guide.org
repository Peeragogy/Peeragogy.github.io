* To cut to the chase?

You’ll find a quick summary of what peeragogy is all about at [[file:top.org][Top]].  If
it’s not clear from reading that how to apply peeragogy in your
projects, then we’re doing something wrong.  Feel free to drop us a
note to that effect!

* We do think one of the best ways to learn more about this stuff is to get involved!

Here are some of the things we’re doing that you’re welcome to
participate in.  Get in touch via the calendar links (to join live
meetings) and mailing list above — or contact information below.

- *Book.* The [[https://peeragogy.org/][Peeragogy Handbook]] can help any group of people learn or
  create something together. You can read it online or download it for
  free, or buy a paper copy: or join us to help write the 4th Edition.
- *Podcast.* The Peeragogy in Action Podcast is available on all the
  major podcast providers, with videos available on YouTube.
- *Mailing Lists.* Our main public discussions are on Google Groups.  We
  also have a second mailing list that is focused on revisions to the
  Peeragogy Handbook.
- *Live Meetings.* Public meetings appear on our public calendar:
  currently, we’re meeting regularly at 9AM Eastern on Thursdays, with
  other meetings as needed.
- *Annotations.* To comment on peeragogy.org, please make an account at
  Hypothesis, and use the mini-toolbar on the right-hand side of each
  page.
- *Source code.* The Handbook content is archived on Github Pages.
- *Contributed text.* /Handbook/ editors are happy to work with relevant
  submissions in any format. Contact us and help you get the material
  ready.
- *Projects.* We’re currently managing subprojects inside the /Handbook/
  itself, using Emacs and Org Mode.  We made a written guide for
  newcomers — but if you’re new to these tools it might be better to
  drop a line and ask one of us for a quick tutorial.
- *More details.* Please have a look at this [[https://github.com/Peeragogy/peeragogy-handbook/wiki/Quickstart-guide][longer quickstart guide]] for
  more information about our tools and workflow, and more ways to get
  involved.

* What would you be getting yourself into if you did get involved?

Active subprojects of the Peeragogy project include:
- work on this [[file:website.org][Website]],
- work the [[file:project.org][Project]] as a whole,
- a [[file:course.org][Course]],
- our [[file:podcast.org][Podcast]],
- at any given point in time, some [[file:paper.org][Papers]] in progress,
- as well as [[file:community.org][Community]] development,
- and last but not least, work on the 4th edition of the [[file:handbook.org][Peeragogy Handbook]].
