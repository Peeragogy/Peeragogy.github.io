Meaning-carrying tools, like handbooks or maps, can help collect content
and stories as well as assist others who want to adopt the idea.

* Problem
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: problem
    :END:

Established ideas have knowledge cartography challenges for newcomers,
consider trying to decipher a subway map in a foreign city. When the
idea or system is only "newly discovered", the associated meanings may
not be well understood, and indeed they may not have been created. Even
if a topic is only "personally new", it can be hard to find one's way
around.

* Solution
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: solution
    :END:

The process of creating the guide can go hand-in-hand with figuring out
how the system works. Thus, techniques of
[[http://knowledgecartography.org/][knowledge cartography]] and
[[http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/r-97-47/two.html][meaning
making]] are useful for would-be guide creators.[fn:1]

* Rationale
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: rationale
    :END:

It is important to keep in mind how "the map is not the territory," and
map-making is only one facet of shared human activity. For instance, a
pattern description can be thought of as a "micro-map" of a specific
activity. These maps are not useful if they are divorced from practice.
The process of creating a guide creates a certain formality to the
project, forcing participants to catalogue and explicate their idea.
Additionally, the act generally leads to deadlines which can help prod
individuals to work on the project more regularly.

* Resolution

Writing down this pattern clarifies the importance of creating a guide
for your idea if you want others to adopt it for use.[fn:2] If people
complain that they are confused, now we know why.

[fn:1] We started the Peeragogy project by collaboratively making an
       outline for the Peeragogy Handbook. We recommended this
       handbook-making practice to others, as a way to learn
       collaboratively and build a strong group.

[fn:2] As [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html][Richard
       Stallman]] wrote about free software documentation: "The biggest
       deficiency in free operating systems is not in the software---it
       is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in these
       systems. Many of our most important programs do not come with
       full manuals. Documentation is an essential part of any software
       package; when an important free software package does not come
       with a free manual, that is a major gap."

[fn:3] Regarding connections with programming per se: we are not
       currently making software in the Peeragogy project, but we do
       continually evaluate and assemble software tools to support our
       activities. We often run into "bottleneck" problems; see
       *Carrying capacity*. The better we are able to exposit the
       problems we're dealing with, the more likely it is that our
       high-level analysis (and synthesis) has the potential to inform
       future programming work.
