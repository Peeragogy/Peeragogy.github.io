Wrapper {#sec:Wrapper}
=======

### Context {#context .unnumbered}

An active project with more than a few participants, and possibly with
arriving frequently.

### Problem {#problem .unnumbered}

In a very active project, it can be effectively impossible to stay up to
date with all of the details. Not everyone will be able to attend every
meeting (see ) or read every email, and project participants can easily
get lost and drift away. The experience can be even worse for : joining
a project already going can feel like trying to get aboard a rapidly
moving vehicle. If you’ve taken time off, you may feel like things have
moved on so far that they cannot catch up.

### Solution {#solution .unnumbered}

A project contributor can summarizes what has happened recently in the
project, making progress comprehensible to participants who have not
been following all of the details.[^1] If they are kept up to date, a
project’s [landing
page](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/) and also serve as
a sort of “wrapper”, telling people what resources they can expect to
find in the project and how they can participate.

### Rationale {#rationale .unnumbered}

The wrapper must check the public summaries of the project from time to
time to make sure that they accurately represent the facts on the
ground.[^2]

### Resolution {#resolution .unnumbered}

According to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, for free/open
“commons-based” projects to work, it is vital to have both (1) the
ability to contribute small pieces; (2) something that stitches those
pieces together @coases-penguin. The wrapper helps perform this
integrative stitching function, which is often much more challenging
than the job of breaking things down into pieces or just doing one of
the small pieces.

### What’s Next {#whats-next .unnumbered}

We need better practices for automating the wrapping-up process. One of
the latest ideas is to develop a simple visual “dashboard” for the
project that would be a web page people could access and immediately get
an idea of what work is ongoing in the project with links for going more
in depth and/or contributing.

[^1]: In the Peeragogy project, this idea was initially suggested by
    Charlie Danoff, adapting an idea from his Indiana University class
    on EFL teaching led by Faridah Pawan. The idea was that someone take
    on the “wrapper role” – do a weekly pre/post wrap, so that new (and
    existing) users could get a feel for the status of the project at
    any given point in time.

[^2]: In the first year of the Peeragogy project, the “Weekly Roundup”
    by Christopher Tillman Neal served to engage and re-engage members.
    Peeragogues began to eager watched for the weekly reports to see if
    our teams or our names had been mentioned. When there was a holiday
    or break, Chris would announce the hiatus, to keep the flow going.
    In the second year of the project, we did not routinely publish
    summaries of progress, and instead, we assumed that interested
    parties will stay tuned on Google+. More recently, Charlie has begun
    publishing irregular wrap-up [blog
    posts](http://peeragogy.org/peeragogy-wrapper-post-9-feb-5-apr-2015/)
    and e-mails again, which helps keep people who don’t read Google+ up
    to date.
