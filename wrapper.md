#### The Definition:

The wrapper role can be taken on by a project participant who summarizes
everything going on in the project, making the project comprehensible to
participants who haven’t been following all of the details.

#### The Problem:

Joining the project that is already going can feel like trying to get
aboard a rapidly moving vehicle. If you’ve joined and then taken time
off, you may feel like things have moved on so far that it’s impossible
to catch up. In a very active project, it can be effectively impossible
to stay up to date with all of the details.

#### The Solution:

Charlie Danoff
[suggested](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/wiki/rolesdivision-labor)
that someone take on the “wrapper role” – do a weekly pre/post wrap, so
that new (and existing) users would know the status the project is at
any given point in time. The project’s [landing
page](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/host/peeragogy/) also serves as
another sort of “wrapper”, telling people what they can expect to find.

#### Objectives:

In fulfilling the wrapper role, we must check the public summaries of
the project from time to time to make sure that they accurately
represent the facts on the ground.

#### Examples:

In the first year of the Peeragogy project, the “Weekly Roundup” by
Christopher Tillman Neal served to engage and re-engage members.
Peeragogues began to eager watched for the weekly reports to see if our
teams or our names had been mentioned. When there was a holiday or
break, Chris would announce the hiatus, to keep the flow going. In the
second year of the project, we didn’t routinely publish summaries of
progress, and instead, we’ve assumed that interested parties will stay
tuned on Google+. Nevertheless, we maintain internal and external
summaries, ranging from agendas to press releases to quick-start guides.
Regular meetings provide an alternative way to stay up to date: see the
[Heartbeat](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/heartbeat/) pattern.

#### Challenges:

According to the theory proposed by Yochai Benkler, for free/open
“commons-based” projects to work, it is vital to have both (1) the
ability to contribute small pieces; (2) something that stitches those
pieces together <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>. The wrapper performs this
integrative function, which is often much more challenging than the job
of breaking things down into pieces or just doing one of the small
pieces.

#### What’s Next:

We need better practices for wrapping things up at various levels. One
of the latest ideas is to develop a simple visual “dashboard” for the
project.
