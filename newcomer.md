Newcomer 
========

### Context 

A lot of “education” assumes we are speaking to a new generation. In
learning more broadly, the “audience” is often new to the topic.
Sometimes we are the , sometimes we’re the oldtimers.

### Problem 

can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn. They don’t know
where to start.[^1] They may have a bunch of ideas that the oldtimers
have never considered – or they may think they have new ideas, which are
actually a different take on old ideas; see .

### Solution 

It is good to try to become aware of what a needs, and what their
motivations are.[^2] themselves may have only a general idea about what
their goals are, so it can be helpful to add concreteness with .

### Rationale 

in the Peeragogy project have often complained about feeling confused
about what the project is about, suggesting that our has not been
sufficiently clear. Some feel it is too theoretical, which suggests we
need to do more work on on ways to get involved, while also making it
clear that we do not have an exhaustive list in mind. New ideas can
prompt us to consider how we may have been limiting ourselves.[^3]

### Resolution 

The frustration and confusion felt by a familiar to anyone who is
starting something new. An awareness of how to help can help us be more
compassionate to ourselves and others.

### What’s Next 

A more detailed (but non-limiting) “How to Get Involved” walk-through in
text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing
some of the things we’re learning about.[^4]

[^1]: Peeragogy Project participant Régis Barondeau: “I joined this
    handbook project late, making me a ‘newcomer’. When I started to
    catch up, I rapidly faced doubts: Where do I start? How can I help?
    How will I make it, having to read more than 700 posts to catch up?
    What tools are we using ? How do I use them? Etc. Although this
    project is amazingly interesting, catching the train while it
    already reached high speed can be an extreme sport. By taking care
    of newcomers, we might avoid losing valuable contributors because
    they don’t know how and where to start, and keep our own project on
    track.”

[^2]: Peeragogy Project participant Charlotte Pierce: “Joe was working a
    lot on the book, and I thought ‘this is interesting hard work, and
    he shouldn’t have to do this alone.’ As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was
    kindly welcomed and mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I
    asked naive questions and was met with patient answers, guiding
    questions, and resource links. Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself
    into a position to contribute to the workflow by editing the live
    manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity.”

[^3]: Dilrukshi Gamage, Julia Echeverria, and Federico Monaco first
    joined a Peeragogy hangout in February, 2015. They were all
    interested in the idea of designing and running a course on peer
    learning. Although we had done some work on a syllabus, and
    considered the notion of using peeragogical models in formal
    education, we hadn’t tried running a course on the topic of
    peeragogy. There were a number of earlier experiments that *used*
    ideas from peeragogy inside of a formal course, and the difference
    between these two approaches prompted interesting discussions.

    MOOC, hot-syncing our website from Git, etc.
