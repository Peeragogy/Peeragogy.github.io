title: How to put Peeragogy into Action
---

> Welcome to the Peeragogy Accelerator.

The purpose of the *Peeragogy Accelerator* is to use the power of peer
learning to help build great organizations.

We will do this by investing time and energy, rather than money,
building a distributed community of peer learners, and a strongly
vetted collection of best practices.  Our project complements others’
work on sites like
[Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page),
[P2PU](https://www.p2pu.org/en/), but with an applied flavor.  It is
somewhat similar to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and
other start-up accelerators or incubators, but we're doing it the
[commons based peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production)
way.

Here, we present *Peeragogy in Action*, a project guide in four parts.
Each part relates to one or more sections of our handbook, and
suggests activities to try while you explore peer learning.  These
activities are designed for flexible use by widely distributed groups,
collaborating via a light-weight infrastructure. Participants may be
educators, community organizers, designers, hackers, dancers,
students, seasoned peeragogues, or first-timers.  The guide should be
useful for groups who want to build a strong collaboration, as well as
to facilitators or theorists who want to hone their practice or
approach.  Together, we will use our various talents to build
effective methods and models for peer produced peer learning.  We've
labeled the stages Week 1 through Week 4, because that's the schedule
we use, but if you're working through this on your own, you can choose
your own pace.  Let’s get started!

# Week 1. Setting the initial challenge and building a framework for accountability among participants is an important starting point.

*Activity* – Come up with a plan for your work and an agreement, or
informal contract, for your group. You can use the suggestions in this
document as a starting point, but your first task is to revise the
outline we've developed so that it suits your needs.  It might be
helpful to ask: What are you interested in learning?  What is your
primary intended outcome?  What problem do you hope to solve?  How
collaborative does your project need to be?  How will the participants’
expertise in the topic vary?  What sort of support will you and other
participants require?  What problems won’t you solve?

*Technology* – Familiarize yourself with the collaboration tools you
intend to use (e.g. a public wiki, a private forum, a community table,
social media, or something else).  Create something in text, image, or
video form introducing yourself and your project(s) to others in the
worldwide peeragogy community.

*Suggested Resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts I
(‘[Introduction](http://peeragogy.org/)’) and II
(‘[Motivation](http://peeragogy.org/motivation/)’).  For a succinct
theoretical overview, please refer to our literature review, which we
have adapted into a
[Wikipedia page about ‘Peer learning’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – We had a fairly weak project
structure at the outset, which yielded mixed results.  One participant
said: “I definitely think I do better when presented with a framework or
scaffold to use for participation or content development.” Yet the same
person wrote with enthusiasm about being “freed of the requirement or
need for an entrepreneurial visionary.”

pedagogic discourse for research education*. Studies in Higher
Education, 30(5):501–516.

*Further Questions*: **What subject or skill does YOUR group want to learn?**
OR
**What product or service does YOUR group want to produce?**

- identify members & subgroups
- survey members: interests, motivations, skills, experience, time
- other

**What learning theory and practice does the group need to know to put together a successful peer-learning program?** 
OR
**What specific theory and research does the group need to meet production or service goals?**

- who has gone before? ([**Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**](http://peeragogy.github.io/practice.html))
- similar groups & organizations
- best & worst practices
- other similar products, for production
- proven success strategies
- other

# Week 2. Other people can support you in achieving your goal and make the work more fun too.

*Activity* – Write an invitation to someone who can help as a
co-facilitator on your project. Clarify what you hope to learn from them
and what your project has to offer. Helpful questions to consider as you
think about who to invite: What resources are available or missing? What
do you already have that you can build on? How will you find the
necessary resources? Who else is interested in these kinds of
challenges? Go through the these questions again when you have a small
group, and come up with a list of more people you’d like to invite or
consult with as the project progresses.

*Technology* – Identify tools that could potentially be useful during
the project, even if it’s new to you. Start learning how to use them.
Connect with people in other locales who share similar interests or know
the tools.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts IV (‘[Convening a
Group](http://peeragogy.org/convening-a-group/)’) and V (‘[Organizing a
Learning
Context](http://peeragogy.org/organizing-a-learning-context/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – We used a strategy of “open
enrollment.” New people were welcome to join the project at any time. We
also encouraged people to either stay involved or withdraw; several
times over the first year, we required participants to explicitly
reaffirm interest in order to stay registered in the forum and mailing
list.

*Further Questions*: **Identify and select the best learning resources about your topic** 
OR
**Identify and select the best production resources for that product or service**

- published resources
- live resources (people)
- other

**What is the appropriate technology and communications tools and platforms your group needs to accomplish their learning goal?**
OR
**How will these participants identify and select the appropriate technology and communications tools and platforms to accomplish their production goal or service mission?**

- internal platforms & tools including meeting spaces, connecting diverse platforms
- external (public-facing) platforms & tools
- other

# Week 3.  Solidifying your work plan and learning strategy together with concrete measures for ‘success’ can move the project forward significantly.

*Activity* – Distill your ideas by writing an essay, making visual
sketches, or creating a short video to communicate the unique plans for
organization and evaluation that your group will use. By this time, you
should have identified which aspects of the project need to be refined
or expanded. Dive in!

*Technology* – Take time to mentor others or be mentored by someone,
meeting up in person or online. Pair up with someone else and share
knowledge together about one or more tools. You can discuss some of the
difficulties that you’ve encountered, or teach a beginner some tricks.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts VI
(‘[Cooperation](http://peeragogy.org/co-facilitation/)’), VII
(‘[Assessment](http://peeragogy.org/assessment/)’), and at least some of
part II (‘[Peeragogy in
Practice](http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – Perhaps one of the most
important roles in the Peeragogy project was the role of the ‘Wrapper’,
who prepared and circulated weekly summaries of forum activity. This
helped people stay informed about what was happening in the project even
if they didn’t have time to read the forums. We’ve also found that small
groups of people who arrange their own meetings are often the most
productive.

learn.” Harvard Business Review 69.3 (1991); and, Gersick, Connie J.G.

development.” Academy of Management Journal 31.1 (1988): 9-41.

*Further Questions*: **What are your benchmarks for success in your learning enterprise?**
OR
**What are your benchmarks for success in your production enterprise or service organization?**

- survey members
- pilot testing
- formal assessment
- consensus
- other
- what's next?

# Week 4.  Wrap up the project with a critical assessment of progress and directions for future work. Share any changes to this syllabus that you think would be useful for future peeragogues!

*Activity* – Identify the main obstacles you encountered. What are some
goals you were not able to accomplish yet? Did you foresee these
challenges at the outset? How did this project resemble or differ from
others you’ve worked on? How would you do things differently in future
projects? What would you like to tackle next?

*Writing* – Communicate your reflection case. Prepare a short written or
multimedia essay, dealing with your experiences in this course. Share
the results by posting it where others in the broader Peeragogy project
can find it.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts VIII
(‘[Technologies, Services, and
Platforms](http://peeragogy.org/resources/technologies/)’) and IX
(‘[Resources](http://peeragogy.org/resources/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – When we were deciding how to
license our work,  we decided to use CC0, emphasizing  ‘re-usability’
and hoping that other people would come and remix the handbook.  At the
moment, we’re still waiting to see the first remix edition, but we’re
confident that it will come along in due course.  Maybe you’ll be the
one who makes it!

*‘Extra credit’* – Contribute back to one of the other organisations or
projects that helped you on this peeragogical journey. Think about what
you have to offer. Is it a bug fix, a constructive critique, pictures,
translation help, PR, wiki-gnoming or making a cake? Make it something
special, and people will remember you and thank you for it.

<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Since its conception in early 2012, the Peeragogy Project has collected
over 3700 comments in our discussion forum, and over 200 pages of
expository text in the handbook. It has given contributors a new way of
thinking about things together. However, the project has not had the
levels of engagement that should be possible, given the technology
available, the global interest in improving education, and the number of
thoughful participants who expressed interest. We hope that the handbook
and this accompanying syllabus will provide a seed for a new phase of
learning, with many new contributors and new ideas drawn from real-life
applications.

We began with these four questions:

1.  *How does a motivated group of self-learners choose a subject or
    skill to learn?*

2.  *How can this group identify and select the best learning resources
    about that topic?*

3.  *How will these learners identify and select the appropriate
    technology and communications tools and platforms to accomplish
    their learning goal?*

4.  *What does the group need to know about learning theory and practice
    to put together a successful peer-learning program?*


<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 2
------------------------------------------------------------

10 new handbook contributors joined in the project’s second year. We’ve
begun a series of weekly Hangouts on Air that have brought in many
additional discussants, all key people who can help to fulfil
peeragogy’s promise.  The handbook has been considerably improved
through edits and discussion.  The next step for us is putting this work
into action in the *Peeragogy Accelerator*.

<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 3
------------------------------------------------------------

We published our plans as “Building the Peeragogy Accelerator”,
presenting it at OER14 and inviting feedback. In the run up to this, we
had been very active creating additional abstracts and submitting them
to conferences. However, despite our efforts we failed to recruit any
newcomers for the trial run of the Accelerator. Even so, piloting the
Accelerator with some of our own projects worked reasonably well,[^1]
but we decided to focus on the handbook in the second half of the year.
As the project’s line-up shifted, participants reaffirmed the importance
of having “no camp counsellors.” In the last quarter of 2014, we created
the workbook that is now presented in Part I, as a quickstart guide to
peeragogy. We also revised the pattern catalog, and used the revised
format to create a “distributed roadmap” for the Peeragogy project –
featured in Chapter 7 of the third edition of the
handbook.
