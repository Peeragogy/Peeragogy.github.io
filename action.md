## New content: Peeragogical Innovations (9 week pilot)
TESTING TESTING TESTING - Charlotte's first edit attempt

**January 2020**
 
In this course students will work together to design new ways to address the global demand for learning opportunities. Our primary textbook will be the Peeragogy Handbook (currently in a 3rd edition). This text may be of particular interest to students in the Department of Education and the Institute for Global Leadership, however, the accompanying readings are fundamentally interdisciplinary, and anyone from any discipline is welcome. Participants will contribute to critical review, expository writing, media production, and creative design. One outcome will be a collaboratively produced Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) based on the course materials. We will design and develop additional innovative interventions. Peer learning will be practiced throughout, by tailoring the syllabus, developing new ways of processing and presenting the course material, through supportive peer feedback, and in collaborative final projects.


Contact time each week will be divided into a recitation, a practicum, and an open studio.


1. Recitation will be 1 hour with two seminar-style presentations led by students, synthesizing a collection of papers or summarizing a book.
2. Practicum will be a 1 hour long workshop-style interaction where we discuss that week’s material and the next steps in the associated research.
3. Open studio will be 1 hour of time each week to work collaboratively on projects, and will include guest lectures and other smaller group activities.


Our strategy will be to use the Handbook as our primary read/write knowledge base, and to draw on other relevant texts to build a shared language. In order to cover a wide range of material, it is not necessary or expected for every student to read every text, but presentation is required for a passing grade. One of our aims is to learn how to do more as a team than we could accomplish as a loose group of individuals. Discussions will be recorded and shared online to broaden access and engage a wider public. The readings will be frontloaded: the last four weeks of the course will be devoted to the design and prototyping of new interventions that can be developed further after the course.  


By the end of the course, students will be able to synthesize interventions relevant to global economic challenges. They will gain design and media production skills relevant to creating a Massive Open Online Course. It is expected that students will also train the affective dimensions of their engagement with difficult issues, by practicing rigorous self-assessment and developing constructive feedback for their peers. Specifically, students successfully completing the course will build a portfolio of evidence that they can receive major challenges with compassion, respond with an awareness of diverse needs, value others’ perspectives and voices, organize effective networks and strategies, and characterize constructive collaborative efforts and ways to support them.

### Agenda
Wk 1
: Develop a collective intention. The course will involve a lot of thinking about co-design and we will start by co-designing the experience we will have together. We will update this Agenda or “Roadmap” as we work together. We will introduce and distribute Rheingoldian "roles" for our co-learning as well as editorial roles needed for co-producing the next edition of the Peeragogy Handbook, and an Action Review template.

Wk 2.
: A deeper dive into co-learning. Reading and even regurgitating is fairly passive. So, to learn more, students can devise more interesting ways to share the material they are engaging with. Each student will focus on developing expertise in one or two areas during the course, and shared skills in collaboration. 

Wk 3
: Gain experience with agile project management. We will adapt the Handbook's Pattern Catalogue and maintain a record of ‘next steps’ to feed back into our local project(s).

Wk 4
: Develop a networking strategy: Who else should we involve in our learning? We will start reaching out to other people to co-design final outcomes for the class. We will review the "Data Fair" from Data Science for Design as one way to organize such outreach, and discuss which methods will work best for us. For example, students may experiment with uploading text to Wikipedia and engage in discussions there.

Wk 5
: Develop and discuss research designs. What questions will we be addressing? What problems will we be solving? What problems will we not be solving? What are appropriate research methods?

Wk 6
: Gain experience with dialogue-facilitation strategies. How do the approaches to peer learning that we have been studying so far in the course relate to each other? E.g., imagine a conversation between Benkler and Alexander, or Ostrom and Batchelor: would they agree about anything? Disagree? We will explore different facilitation strategies to strategically prepare for the design phase in the final weeks of the course, asking "What would be a good design for peer learning in your planned intervention?"

Wk 7
: Understand technologies used in peer production and small-scale collaborations. What additional tools and literacies will we need to "contribute back" during the rest of the course? What technologies do the projects that we are developing need in order to work optimally? Do these tools exist? What would do we need to learn or develop to bring them into existence, or to use existing tools well?

Wk 8
: Discuss the relationship between learning and social movements. How can we contextualise the Peeragogy project relative to other initiatives? Does the project itself have "peers" that it can learn from?

Wk 9
: Put peeragogy within its social and historical context. What does the past, present, and future of learning look like? What role does peeragogy play in economic development and sustainability?


(Weeks 1-9 are paired with readings in the Peeragogy Handbook and  Readings from the list below.)

### Ideas for final collaborative projects
Some questions that end-of-term projects might address include the following:


* Quantitative trends can be easily analysed, but how do we measure, e.g., whether our design patterns are actually useful? Does using the patterns produce a qualitative change in the group; e.g., do they lead to a feeling of happiness for participants?  Can we understand and revise our thinking about collaboration using Christopher Alexander’s fifteen principles from the Nature of Order? 
* Are we successfully inventing new ways of relating that address the needs of people with limited access to educational opportunity?  What does the global need look like?  What inventions and interventions are out there now?  What’s missing?
* Can we extract re-usable patterns from the literature on MOOCS, crowdfunding and other collaborative or collective projects?  What are the best ways we can “scale up” the Peeragogy project and this course? And/or, how would we make peeragogy a more effective practical approach for projects at the local scale? [m][n][o][p]
* Can we develop our strategy for translating our learning within the Peeragogy project to (and from) diverse audiences?  Who else should we be talking to?  What other projects are doing similar things?
* Borrowing a technique from religious studies, we can ask: how does Peeragogy differ from other related approaches? Is the world ready for a global peer learning movement? What can peer learning contribute to ongoing peer production efforts and vice versa?

### Assessment

Students should consider the list of intended Learning Outcomes in this syllabus when working on their self-assessments. Michael Wride’s Guide to Self-Assessment (2017) will be discussed on the first day of class.

A representative timetable is presented in this spreadsheet: http://bit.ly/2OItJNa  This will be jointly revised during the first week of class and kept up to date with any changes.

## Meeting times and locations
- Monday -- 1 hour hands on editing session, 8PM Jitsi
- Thursday -- 1 hour discussion session, 2PM Zoom

### Additional organizational details
#### Expect to do a lot of reading (and some writing).
(This will be revised for pilot version.)
6 hours of homework each week is the federally mandated minimum corresponding to 3 contact hours for higher education courses in the US.  If you read at a rate of 2 minutes per page, you can cover 180 pages in this time.  This means that you could cover up to 1800[u] pages in 10 weeks. Since you will have other tasks too, 1000-1500 pages is a reasonable estimate of how many pages you might expect to read over the course of the semester.  Since the books that you will be responsible for presenting in Recitation are generally much shorter, you are expected to take the initiative to find and digest supplementary materials. You are encouraged to use a tool like Zotero to log your reading and share your personal bibliography and notes, and also to share summaries and analysis more widely, e.g., on Wikipedia or in updates to the Peeragogy Handbook. Presenters are invited to enrich the presentations in their Recitation sections as they see appropriate.[v]

#### The Recitation and Practicum will be recorded and disseminated
we will ask for an appropriate waiver. Students should also sign the CC Zero waiver in advance of making any Peeragogy Handbook contributions, and agree to CC-By-SA for any Wikipedia contributions.

#### Final projects should be demonstrably collaborative. 
Each student is responsible for their own one-page summary and evaluation of their contributions.


## Old content: Welcome to the Peeragogy Accelerator.

The purpose of the *Peeragogy Accelerator* is to use the power of peer
learning to help build great organizations.

We will do this by investing time and energy, rather than money,
building a distributed community of peer learners, and a strongly
vetted collection of best practices.  Our project complements others’
work on sites like
[Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page) and
[P2PU](https://www.p2pu.org/en/), but with an applied flavor.  It is
somewhat similar to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and
other start-up accelerators or incubators, but we're doing it the
[commons based peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production)
way.

Here, we present *Peeragogy in Action*, a project guide in four parts.
Each part relates to one or more sections of our handbook, and
suggests activities to try while you explore peer learning.  These
activities are designed for flexible use by widely distributed groups,
collaborating via a light-weight infrastructure. Participants may be
educators, community organizers, designers, hackers, dancers,
students, seasoned peeragogues, or first-timers.  The guide should be
useful for groups who want to build a strong collaboration, as well as
to facilitators or theorists who want to hone their practice or
approach.  Together, we will use our various talents to build
effective methods and models for peer produced peer learning.  We've
labeled the phases as Stage 1 through Stage 4, because that's the schedule
we use, but if you're working through this on your own, you can choose
your own pace.  Let’s get started!

# Stage 1. Set the initial challenge and build a framework for accountability among participants. (1-3 weeks)

*Activity* – Come up with a plan for your work and an agreement, or
informal contract, for your group. You can use the suggestions in this
document as a starting point, but your first task is to revise the
outline we've developed so that it suits your needs.  It might be
helpful to ask: What are you interested in learning?  What is your
primary intended outcome?  What problem do you hope to solve?  How
collaborative does your project need to be?  How will the participants’
expertise in the topic vary?  What sort of support will you and other
participants require?  What problems won’t you solve?

*Technology* – Familiarize yourself with the collaboration tools you
intend to use (e.g. a public wiki, a private forum, a community table,
social media, or something else).  Create something in text, image, or
video form introducing yourself and your project(s) to others in the
worldwide peeragogy community.

*Suggested Resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts I
(‘[Introduction](http://peeragogy.org/)’) and II
(‘[Motivation](http://peeragogy.org/motivation/)’).  For a succinct
theoretical overview, please refer to our literature review, which we
have adapted into a
[Wikipedia page about ‘Peer learning’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – We had a fairly weak project
structure at the outset, which yielded mixed results.  One participant
said: “I definitely think I do better when presented with a framework or
scaffold to use for participation or content development.” Yet the same
person wrote with enthusiasm about being “freed of the requirement or
need for an entrepreneurial visionary.”

*Further Reading* – Boud, D. and Lee, A. (2005). *‘Peer learning’ as
pedagogic discourse for research education*. Studies in Higher
Education, 30(5):501–516.

*Further Questions*: **What subject or skill does YOUR group want to learn?**
OR
**What product or service does YOUR group want to produce?**

- identify members & subgroups
- survey members: interests, motivations, skills, experience, time
- other

**What learning theory and practice does the group need to know to put together a successful peer-learning program?** 
OR
**What specific theory and research does the group need to meet production or service goals?**

- who has gone before? ([**Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**](http://peeragogy.github.io/practice.html))
- similar groups & organizations
- best & worst practices
- other similar products, for production
- proven success strategies
- other

# Stage 2. Bring in other people to support your shared goals, and make the work more fun too. (1-2 weeks)

*Activity* – Write an invitation to someone who can help as a
co-facilitator on your project. Clarify what you hope to learn from them
and what your project has to offer. Helpful questions to consider as you
think about who to invite: What resources are available or missing? What
do you already have that you can build on? How will you find the
necessary resources? Who else is interested in these kinds of
challenges? Go through the these questions again when you have a small
group, and come up with a list of more people you’d like to invite or
consult with as the project progresses.

*Technology* – Identify tools that could potentially be useful during
the project, even if it’s new to you. Start learning how to use them.
Connect with people in other locales who share similar interests or know
the tools. Find related groups, communities, and forums and engage with others to start a dialogue.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts IV (‘[Convening a
Group](http://peeragogy.org/convening-a-group/)’) and V (‘[Organizing a
Learning
Context](http://peeragogy.org/organizing-a-learning-context/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – We used a strategy of “open
enrollment.” New people were welcome to join the project at any time. We
also encouraged people to either stay involved or withdraw; several
times over the first year, we required participants to explicitly
reaffirm interest in order to stay registered in the forum and mailing
list.

*Further Reading* – Schmidt, J. Philipp. (2009). Commons-Based Peer
Production and education. Free Culture Research Workshop Harvard
University, 23 October 2009.

*Further Questions*: **Identify and select the best learning resources about your topic** 
OR
**Identify and select the best production resources for that product or service**

- published resources
- live resources (people)
- other

**What is the appropriate technology and communications tools and platforms your group needs to accomplish their learning goal?**
OR
**How will these participants identify and select the appropriate technology and communications tools and platforms to accomplish their production goal or service mission?**

- internal platforms & tools including meeting spaces, connecting diverse platforms
- external (public-facing) platforms & tools
- other

# Stage 3.  Solidifying your work plan and learning strategy together with concrete measures for ‘success’ to move the project forward. (1-3 weeks)

*Activity* – Distill your ideas by writing an essay, making visual
sketches, or creating a short video to communicate the unique plans for
organization and evaluation that your group will use. By this time, you
should have identified which aspects of the project need to be refined
or expanded. Dive in!

*Technology* – Take time to mentor others or be mentored by someone,
meeting up in person or online. Pair up with someone else and share
knowledge together about one or more tools. You can discuss some of the
difficulties that you’ve encountered, or teach a beginner some tricks.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts VI
(‘[Cooperation](http://peeragogy.org/co-facilitation/)’), VII
(‘[Assessment](http://peeragogy.org/assessment/)’), and at least some of
part II (‘[Peeragogy in
Practice](http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – Perhaps one of the most
important roles in the Peeragogy project was the role of the ‘Wrapper’,
who prepared and circulated weekly summaries of forum activity. This
helped people stay informed about what was happening in the project even
if they didn’t have time to read the forums. We’ve also found that small
groups of people who arrange their own meetings are often the most
productive.

learn.” Harvard Business Review 69.3 (1991); and, Gersick, Connie J.G.

development.” Academy of Management Journal 31.1 (1988): 9-41.

*Further Questions*: **What are your benchmarks for success in your learning enterprise?**
OR
**What are your benchmarks for success in your production enterprise or service organization?**

- survey members
- pilot testing
- formal assessment
- consensus
- other
- what's next?

# Stage 4.  Wrap up the project with a critical assessment of progress and directions for future work. Share any changes to this syllabus that you think would be useful for future peeragogues! (1-2 weeks).

*Activity* – Identify the main obstacles you encountered. What are some
goals you were not able to accomplish yet? Did you foresee these
challenges at the outset? How did this project resemble or differ from
others you’ve worked on? How would you do things differently in future
projects? What would you like to tackle next?

*Writing* – Communicate your reflection case. Prepare a short written or
multimedia essay, dealing with your experiences in this course. Share
the results by posting it where others in the broader Peeragogy project
can find it.

*Suggested resources* – The Peeragogy Handbook, parts VIII
(‘[Technologies, Services, and
Platforms](http://peeragogy.org/resources/technologies/)’) and IX
(‘[Resources](http://peeragogy.org/resources/)’).

*Observations from the Peeragogy project* – When we were deciding how to
license our work,  we decided to use CC0, emphasizing  ‘re-usability’
and hoping that other people would come and remix the handbook.  At the
moment, we’re still waiting to see the first remix edition, but we’re
confident that it will come along in due course.  Maybe you’ll be the
one who makes it!

*‘Extra credit’* – Contribute back to one of the other organisations or
projects that helped you on this peeragogical journey. Think about what
you have to offer. Is it a bug fix, a constructive critique, pictures,
translation help, PR, wiki-gnoming or making a cake? Make it something
special, and people will remember you and thank you for it.

free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html)” (1992).

*Further Questions*: Write your own!

<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Since its conception in early 2012, the Peeragogy Project has collected
over 3700 comments in our discussion forum, and over 200 pages of
expository text in the handbook. It has given contributors a new way of
thinking about things together. However, the project has not had the
levels of engagement that should be possible, given the technology
available, the global interest in improving education, and the number of
thoughful participants who expressed interest. We hope that the handbook
and this accompanying syllabus will provide a seed for a new phase of
learning, with many new contributors and new ideas drawn from real-life
applications.

We began with these four questions:

1.  *How does a motivated group of self-learners choose a subject or
    skill to learn?*

2.  *How can this group identify and select the best learning resources
    about that topic?*

3.  *How will these learners identify and select the appropriate
    technology and communications tools and platforms to accomplish
    their learning goal?*

4.  *What does the group need to know about learning theory and practice
    to put together a successful peer-learning program?*


<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 2
------------------------------------------------------------

10 new handbook contributors joined in the project’s second year. We’ve
begun a series of weekly Hangouts on Air that have brought in many
additional discussants, all key people who can help to fulfil
peeragogy’s promise.  The handbook has been considerably improved
through edits and discussion.  The next step for us is putting this work
into action in the *Peeragogy Accelerator*.

<span>Micro-</span>Case Study: The Peeragogy Project, Year 3
------------------------------------------------------------

We published our plans as “Building the Peeragogy Accelerator”,
presenting it at OER14 and inviting feedback. In the run up to this, we
had been very active creating additional abstracts and submitting them
to conferences. However, despite our efforts we failed to recruit any
newcomers for the trial run of the Accelerator. Even so, piloting the
Accelerator with some of our own projects worked reasonably well,[^1]
but we decided to focus on the handbook in the second half of the year.
As the project’s line-up shifted, participants reaffirmed the importance
of having “no camp counsellors.” In the last quarter of 2014, we created
the workbook that is now presented in Part I, as a quickstart guide to
peeragogy. We also revised the pattern catalog, and used the revised
format to create a “distributed roadmap” for the Peeragogy project –
featured in Chapter 7 of the third edition of the
handbook.
