#### Definition:

The difficulty breaks down like this:

1.  Certainly we cannot get things done just by talking about them.

2.  And yet, feedback can be useful, i.e., if there are mechanisms for
    responding to it in a useful fashion.

3.  The associated anti-pattern is a special case of the prototypical
    Batesonian [double bind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind),
    “the father who says to his son: go ahead, criticize me, but
    strongly hints that all effective criticism will be very unwelcome”
    <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>, p. 88.

#### Problem:

Criticism is not always useful. Sometimes it is just “noise”.

#### (Bogus) Solution:

It’s tempting to create “open” systems that inadvertantly replicate the
double bind – by being open to criticism, but unable to act on it
effectively.

#### Challenges:

A long list of criticisms that haven’t been dealt with is maybe better
than no communication at all, but it’s also a tell-tale sign of deeper
dissatisfaction. It’s better to make sure you have enough bandwidth (see
[Carrying
Capacity](http://peeragogy.org/patterns-usecases/patterns-and-heuristics/carrying-capacity/))
for dealing with a given class of problems and issues. Adjust your focus
accordingly, but be careful (see
“[Isolation](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/isolation/)”).

#### What’s Next:

We have hinted that, in this project, [effective criticism is very
welcome](http://peeragogy.org/how-to-use-this-handbook/)! But
understanding what makes criticism effective is, in general, still a
research problem.
