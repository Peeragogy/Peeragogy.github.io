What is a pattern?
------------------

A pattern is anything that has a repeated effect. In the context of
peeragogy, the practice is to repeat processes and interactions that
advance the learning mission. Frequent occurrences that are not
desirable are called anti-patterns!

> **Christopher Alexander**: “Each pattern describes a problem which
> occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the
> core of the solution to that problem, in a way that you can use this
> solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way
> twice.” <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>

Patterns provide a framework that can be applied to similar issues but
may be metaphorically solved in different ways, sometimes in real world
or face to face events and other times in digital space.  Outside of
Alexander’s own work in architecture, one the first groups to adopt a
design pattern way of thinking about things were computer programmers. 
Writing in the foreward to Richard P. Gabriel’s *Patterns of Software*,
Alexander emphasizes that the key question to ask about any design
approach is: does it help us build better?

> **Christopher Alexander**: “What is the Chartres of programming? What
> task is at a high enough level to inspire people writing programs, to
> reach for the stars?” <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>

We think that Peeragogy stands a good chance of being a “killer app” for
pattern-based design.  Learning bridges physical and virtual worlds all
the time.  And, in fact, a *Network of Learning* was the 18th pattern
that Christopher Alexander introduced in his book, *A Pattern Language*.

> **Christopher Alexander**: “Work in piecemeal ways to decentralize the
> process of learning and enrich it through contact with many places and
> people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home or walking
> through the city, professionals willing to take on the young as
> helpers, older children teaching younger children, museums, youth
> groups travelling, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old
> people, and so on.” <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>

Peeragogy can help to extend and enrich this network, and, as we shall
see, patterns can be used by those involved to do ongoing “emergent”
design, not only by building new structures, but by adapting and
improving our catalog of patterns as we go.  For consistency, and easy
use, adaptation, and extension we present the patterns using the
following template.  The format is meant to be neutral and easy to work
with – it’s, intentionally, an outline that you might use to write a
short abstract describing an active project.

> **Title**: *Encapsulate the idea - possibly include a subtitle*
>
> **Definition**: *Explain the idea and the context in which it is
> meaningful.  (You can link to other patterns, if they are useful for
> clarifying the relevant context.)*
>
> **Problem**: *Explain why there’s some issue to address here.*
>
> **Solution**: *Talk about an idea about how to address the issue.*
>
> **Challenges**: *Talk about what can go wrong.*
>
> **What’s Next**: *Talk about specific next steps.  (Again, link to
> other patterns, if they are useful for clarifying the relevant
> context.)*
>
> The pattern template also includes the following optional elements:
>
> <span>[</span>**Objectives**: *Explain the purpose(s) of the proposed
> solution’s functioning, if they aren’t fully specified by the
> description of the solution itself.*<span>]</span>
>
> <span>[</span>**Examples**: *Present example(s) that have been
> encountered, if this aids comprehension.*<span>]</span>
>
> <span>[</span>**References**: *Citations, if relevant.*<span>]</span>

Notice the emphasis the active aspect of things – the “What’s Next”
section concretely links the patterns we discuss here to the Peeragogy
project.  If you adapt them for use in your own project, you’re likely
to have a different set of next steps. Although we think that these
patterns can be generally useful, they aren’t useful in the abstract,
but rather, as a way for discussing what we actually do.

Patterns of peeragogy
---------------------

Here is our index of the main patterns we’ve found so far (described in
more detail after the jump):

-   [Wrapper](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/wrapper/) - Front end
    appearance to participants. Consolidate and summarize.

-   [Discerning a
    pattern](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/discerning-a-pattern/) -
    Found a pattern? Give it a title and record an example. (Woah,
    meta!)

-   [Polling for
    ideas](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/polling-for-ideas/) - Invite
    brainstorming, collecting ideas, questions, and solutions.

-   [Creating a guide](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/creating-a-guide/)
    - Overviews expose the lay of the land. Collecting content and
    stories.

-   [Newcomer](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/newcomer/) - Create a guide
    for “beginner’s mind” and help avoid need to introduce new members
    each “meeting.”

-   [Roadmap](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/roadmap/) - Plans for future
    work, direction towards a goal, dynamic

-   [Roles](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/roles/) - Specialize and mix
    it up. Play to participants strengths and skills.

-   [Project
    focus](http://peeragogy.org/focusing-on-a-specific-project/) -
    Lightbulb moment: Most specific projects involve learning!

-   [Carrying
    capacity](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/carrying-capacity/) - Know
    your limits, find ways to get other people involved.

-   [Heartbeat](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/heartbeat/) - The
    “heartbeat” of the group keeps energy flowing.

-   [Moderation](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/moderation/) - When
    leaders step back, dynamics can improve; moderator serves as
    champion and editor.

-   [Use or make?](http://peeragogy.org/patterns/praxis-vs-poeisis/) -
    Repurposing, tinkering, or creating from scratch?

We’ll introduce one more pattern in a short [case
study](http://peeragogy.org/case-study-learning-to-use-technology-with-peers-the-case-of-swats/)
that appears in Chapter [swats].

Anti-patterns for Peeragogy
---------------------------

And some “anti-patterns” (things to avoid if possible).  Note that we
use the same template to talk about both patterns and anti-patterns, but
here, although the proposed solution may look like a good idea
initially, but it doesn’t work so well over the long term. Pay
particular attention to the challenges that arise in practice!

-   [Isolation](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/isolation/) -  A tale
    of silos, holes, and not-invented-here.

-   [Magical
    thinking](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/magical-thinking/) -
     “One meeting will (not) change everything!”

-   [Messy with
    Lurkers](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/co-learning-messy-with-lurkers/)
    - What happens when joining is low-cost and completion is
    low-benefit.

-   [Misunderstanding
    Power](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/misunderstanding-power/) -
    The workload is almost never evenly distributed.

-   [Navel Gazing](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/navel-gazing/) - “I
    have this really great idea…”

-   [Stasis](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/stasis/) - What is the
    driver behind open source, commons-oriented collaborative projects? 
    (Because, let’s face it, it doesn’t always work.)

-   [Stuck at the level of weak
    ties](http://peeragogy.org/antipatterns/stuck-at-the-level-of-weak-ties/)
    - Can we deepen the connection?

A peeragogy pattern language
----------------------------

By looking at how patterns combine in real and hypothetical use cases,
you can start to identify a *pattern language* that can be used in your
projects. We can get a simplified view of these connections with the
following diagram.  It’s important to clarify that everyone doesn’t do
it the same way.  Here, the *Roadmap* is given a central position, but
some peer learning projects will forego making a specific, detailed
plan; their plan is just to see what develops. You can see here how
peeragogy patterns often break down further into individual micro-steps:
we’ll say more about that shortly.

![image](../pictures/pattern-language.jpg)

The subsequent main sections of this book –
[*Convene*](http://peeragogy.org/convene/),
[*Organize*](http://peeragogy.org/organize/),
[*Cooperate*](http://peeragogy.org/facilitate/) and
[*Assess*](http://peeragogy.org/assessment/) – represent big clusters of
patterns that are likely to come up time and again in various projects. 
We can think of these as East, South, West, and North in the diagram
above. You are of course encouraged to invent your own patterns and to
connect them in new ways. Each project has a unique design, and it’s own
unique way in which things play out in practice.  What we’ve put
together here is a starter kit.

> **Christopher Alexander**: “These ideas—patterns—are hardly more than
> glimpses of a much deeper level of structure, and is ultimately within
> this deeper level of structure, that the origin of life occurs.”
> <span>[</span>2<span>]</span>

The peeragogy patterns suggest a *social* way to implement useful
problem-solving heuristics [3]:

-   We simplify things for **Newcomers**. We don’t expect a newcomer to
    enter at full speed.

-   We use a **Roadmap** to guide us from one phase to another, while
    the project’s central **Heartbeat** helps us attend to the central
    focus.

-   We announce significant changes through a **Wrapper** who describes
    any new directions taken by the project.

-   We divide work up not only horizontally among different **Roles**,
    but also temporally by using the **Roadmap**.

-   Whenever we’re **Creating a Guide** we’re really thinking in terms
    of analogies.

-   When we ask for help, we often avail ourselves of some sort of
    **Moderation**.

-   One simple way to ask for help is **Polling for Ideas**.

-   If you know the answer (or if you know someone who knows), then you
    may be able to reuse it. We often reuse instead of making-anew: ask
    “**Use or Make**?”

-   It is important to give it a rest so as not to exhaust one’s own
    **Carrying Capacity** – or get too far out of sync with the group.

-   One of the things that experts are good at is **Discerning a
    Pattern**. This allows them to simplify their processing. We like to
    describe and share the patterns we find.

-   If we know why something is hard, then we may be able to use that
    information to **Create a Guide** that will help get around, or at
    least better cope with, the difficulty.
