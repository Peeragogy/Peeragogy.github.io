complex, or even insurmountable problem. It won't go away, but a
workable solution doesn't present itself, either. If there is a
candidate solution, it's also clear there are not enough resources for
it to be feasible.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="forces"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Forces</span></span></h1><section><blockquote><p><span>  </span><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/difficulty.png" /><span> </span><strong><span>Difficulty</span></strong><span>: bringing about meaningful

Some may put
considerable energy into pondering, discussing, exploring and feeling
stuck. Some may want more concrete progress, and notice the time passing
by. In a group setting, when the forward-movers ultimately try to act,
those who are more wrapped up in the experience of pondering and
exploring may rebel, if they feel that they are being left behind.
Inaction may seem like the only safe choice, but it has risks too. And,
once moving, things can easily get bogged down again.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>One way to make progress when you're stuck is to ask a specific question
to someone who may be able to help you get unstuck. Formulating a
question helps your thinking become more concrete. Sometimes you'll see
that a solution was within your grasp all along. Often, one question
won't be enough, but you can repeat the process. In this way, you can
reduce a large, complex, or ephemeral concern into a collection of
smaller, specific, manageable tasks with clear next steps and success
criteria. Use a Scrapbook to make note of all the small things, and
weave them into your project Roadmap. This will show how the small
pieces relate to the bigger picture. If you have a fairly specific idea
about what you want to do, but you're finding it difficult to get it
done, don't just ask for advice: recruit material help (cf. Carrying
capacity). One example of a specific project from the Peeragogy project
is our work on this paper, which had a specific target audience, a set
of associated deadlines, and allowed us to get help from pattern
experts.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>We've seen time and again that having a specific project is a recipe for
getting concrete, and that getting concrete is necessary for bringing
about change. Asking for help (which is what happens when you vocalize a
question) is one of the best ways to gain coherence. Making yourself
understood can go a long way toward resolving deeper difficulties.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="resolution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Resolution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Where you run into </span><strong><span>difficulty</span></strong><span>, getting specific paves the way for
incremental forward progress and helps to overcome </span><strong><span>inertia</span></strong><span>. The
struggle between consensus and action is resolved in a tangible project
that combines action with dialog. Learning something new is a strong
sign that things are working. In the Peeragogy project, we have
completed many projects during our weekly hangouts, for example "hive
editing" an abstract for submission to a conference.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="example-1"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example 1</span></span></h1><section><p><span>At first glance, the Wikimedia Foundation's mission may seem like a good

Peeragogy can also happen in neighborhoods, and among persons sharing
long-term co-habitation. While a traditional Dormitory may not be
necessary, a shared rented or cooperatively-owned living/working
environment could be an asset for peeragogues working together on A
specific project.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="what&apos;s-next-in-the-peeragogy-project"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>What's Next in the Peeragogy Project</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Let's use our pattern catalog to build specific, tangible "what's next"
