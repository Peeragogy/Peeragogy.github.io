effectively. Facilitation can be particularly helpful for individuals
who, based on a certain level of insecurity or inexperience, tend to
lurk rather than participate. At the same time, in peeragogy, a
facilitator isn't necessarily an "authority." Rather, facilitation work
is done in service to the group and the group dialogue and process. For
example, a facilitator may simply "hold space" for the group by setting
up a meeting or a regular series of discussions.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="co-facilitating-in-peer-to-peer-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Co-facilitating in peer-to-peer learning</span></span></h2><section><p><span>Co-facilitation can be found in collaborations between two or
more people who need each other to complete a task, for example, learn
about a given subject, author a technical report, solve a problem, or
conduct research. Dee Fink writes that "in this process, there has to be
some kind of change in the learner. No change, no learning" [1].
Significant learning requires that there be some kind of lasting change
that is important in terms of the learner's life; in peeragogy, one way
to measure the effectiveness of co-facilitation is to look for a change
in the peer group.</span></p><p><span>Co-facilitation roles can be found in groups/teams like basketball,
health, Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual groups, etc. For example,
self-help groups are composed of people who gather to share common
problems and experiences associated with a particular problem,
condition, illness, or personal circumstance.  There are some further
commonalities across different settings.  Commenting on the work of Carl
Rogers:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>Godfrey Barrett-Lennard</span></strong><span>: The educational situation which most
  effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (1) threat
  to the self of the learner is reduced a minimum, and (2)
  differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated.
  [2]</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Part of the facilitator's role is to create a safe place for learning to
take place; but they should also challenge the participants.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>  </span><strong><span>John Heron</span></strong><span>: Too much hierarchical control, and participants become
  passive and dependent or hostile and resistant. They wane in
  self-direction, which is the core of all learning. Too
  much cooperative guidance may degenerate into a subtle kind of
  nurturing oppression, and may deny the group the benefits of totally
  autonomous learning. Too much autonomy for participants and
  laissez-faire on your part, and they may wallow in ignorance,
  misconception, and chaos. [3]</span></p></blockquote></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="co-facilitating-discussion-forums"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Co-facilitating discussion forums</span></span></h2><section><p><span>If peers are preparing a forum discussion, here are some ideas from
