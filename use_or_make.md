Use or make 
===========

### Context 

Peer production, as the name indicates, is about producing, in other
words – “making.” But it also involves building on (“using”) the work of
others.

### Problem 

People are often very attached to their own projects and don’t have a
sense of how their own initiatives can benefit from connecting with
others. Many projects die because the cost of <span>**[Reinventing the
Wheel](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ReinventingTheWheel)**</span> [c2] is too
high.

### Solution 

Learning and creativity often involve recycling and remixing others’
ideas and techniques. Duchamp’s
<span>[readymades](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp&oldid=660437742)</span>
were a reaction against a narrow perspective on originality; DJs turn
songs that already exist into new modes of musical expression. Make it
possible for other people to remix and adapt your work too.[^1] Show
appreciation when they do. In the case of shared content, make backups
so that you don’t have to worry about losing the record of idea that
another person might not have noticed was important.

### Rationale 

<span>**Creating a guide**</span> can help people avoid reinventing the
wheel.[^2] There are lots of tools and approaches out there – *use
them*, at least on a trial basis; return to the ones that work.[^3]

### Resolution 

Noticing how difficult it is to remake things every time, and
encapsulating what we observed with the <span>**Use or Make**</span>
pattern reminds us to always consider re-purposing the work of others,
to think about how others can leapfrog ahead, building on our
experiences by incorporating our work.

### What’s Next 

We’ve spun off the pattern catalog from the *Peeragogy Handbook* into
this paper, sharing it with a new community and gaining new
perspectives. Let’s look for other parts of the handbook we can spin
off!

[^1]: As a first key step, we’ve released the *Peeragogy Handbook* using
    the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0). This legal
    instrument grants the greatest possible leeway to downstream users;

    editors or a comment to this effect on
    <http://peeragogy.org/resources/license/> suffices.

[^2]: Clearly we are not the first people to notice these things!
    Consider the following quote from the Wikimedia Foundation:
    “Unfortunately, many of our most valuable resources for learning and
    evaluation are scattered across wikis, buried in archived reports,
    incomplete, out of date, or are only available in a single language.
    As a result, we sometimes find ourselves re-inventing the wheel:
    missing opportunities, repeating common mistakes, and working harder
    than we need to because we are not aware of related projects done by
    others who came before us.” via

[^3]: As Willow Brugh of Geeks without Bounds and the MIT Media Lab
    remarked as a guest in one of our hangouts
    (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpyQfYVKfBI>): people often think
    that they need to build a community, and so fail to recognize that
    they are already part of a community.
