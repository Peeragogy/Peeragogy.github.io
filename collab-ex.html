directions of inquiry and develop their skills as investigators and
teachers (in the broadest sense of the word). The basic mode of a
Collaborative Exploration centers on interactions over a delimited
period of time in small groups. Engagement takes place either online,
for instance via Google+, or face-to-face. The aim is to create an
experience of re-engagement with oneself as an avid learner and
inquirer. This section combines practical information about how to run
Collaborative Explorations as well as ideas and questions about how to
make sense of what happens in them. A companion entry conveys one
participant's experience with several Collaborative Explorations
(hereafter, "CE").</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="overview-and-contrast-to-cmoocs"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Overview and contrast to cMOOCs</span></span></h2><section><p><span>The tangible goal of any CE is to develop contributions to the topic
defined by the "case", which is written by the host or originator of the
CE in advance, and which is intended to be broad and thought-provoking
(some examples are given below). We aim for a parallel experiential
goal, which is that we hope participants will be impressed at how much
can be learned with a small commitment of time using this structure. The
standard model for an online CE is to have four sessions spaced one week
apart, in which the same small group interacts in real time via the
internet, for an hour per session. Participants are asked to spend at
least 90 minutes between sessions on self-directed inquiry into the
case, and to share their inquiries-in-progress with their small group
and a wider community. Reflection typically involves shifts in
participants' definition of what they want to find out and how. Any
participants wondering how to define a meaningful and useful line of
inquiry are encouraged to review the scenario for the CE, any associated
materials, posts from other participants, and to think about what they
would like to learn more about or dig deeper into. Everyone is left, in
the end, to judge for themselves whether what interests them is
meaningful and useful. [PARAGRAPH] During the live sessions,
participants can expect to do a lot of listening, starting off in the
first session with autobiographical stories that make it easier to trust
and take risks with whoever has joined that CE, and a lot of writing to
gather their thoughts, sometimes privately, sometimes shared. There is
no assumption that participants will pursue the case beyond the limited
duration of the CE. This said, the tools and processes that the CE
employs for purposes of inquiry, dialogue, reflection, and collaboration
are designed to be readily learned by participants, and to translate
well into other settings -- for instance, where they can be used to
support the inquiries of others. In short, online CEs are moderate-sized
open online collaborative learning. It remains to be seen whether the CE
"movement" will attract enough participants to scale up to multiple
learning communities around any given scenario, each hosted by a
different person and running independently. A MOOC (massive open online
course) seeks to get masses of people registered, knowing that a tiny
fraction will complete it, while CE best practices focus on establishing
effective learning in small online communities, and then potentially
scale up from there by multiplying out. CEs aim to address the needs of
online learners who want to:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>dig deeper, make "thicker" connections with other learners</span></p></li><li><p><span>connect topics with their own interests</span></p></li><li><p><span>participate for short periods of time</span></p></li><li><p><span>learn without needing credits or badges</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Currently, even the most high-profile MOOCs do not appear to be
conducive to deep or thick inquiry. For example, while link-sharing is
typical in "connectivist" or "cMOOCs", annotation and discussion of the
contents is less common. By contrast, CEs are structured to elicit
participants' thoughtful reflections and syntheses. The use of the
internet for CEs, in contrast, is guided by two principles of online
education (Taylor 2007).</span></p><ul><li><p><span>Use computers first and foremost to teach or learn things that are
  difficult to teach or learn with pedagogical approaches that are not
  based on computers</span></p></li><li><p><span>Model computer use, at least initially, on known best practices for
  teaching/learning without computers.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Thus, CEs bring in participants from a distance, make rapid connections
with informants or discussants outside the course, and contribute to
evolving guides to materials and resources. At the same time,
participants benefit from the support of instructors/facilitators and
peers who they can trust, and integrate what they learn with their own
personal, pedagogical, and professional development.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="example-scenarios-or-&quot;cases&quot;"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example scenarios or "cases"</span></span></h2><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-3"><h3 class="firn-headline firn-headline-3" id="connectivist-moocs:-learning-and-collaboration,-possibilities-and"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Connectivist MOOCs: Learning and collaboration, possibilities and</span></span></h3><section><p><span>limitations</span></p><p><span>The core faculty member of a graduate program at a public urban

climatic events. Changes might take place at the level of policy,
budget, organization, and so on. It should even be possible to engage

hangouts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Session 1</span></strong><span>: </span><em><span>Participants getting to know each other</span></em><span>. After
freewriting to clarify thoughts and hopes, followed by a quick check-in,
participants take 5 minutes each to tell the story of how they came to

Exploration on the scenario. Other participants note connections with
the speaker and possible ways to extend their interests, sharing these
using an online form.</span></p><p><em><span>Between-session work</span></em><span>: Spend at least 90 minutes on inquiries related

Thinking (CCT) at UMass Boston, I owe my gratitude to Professors Peter
Taylor and Jeremy Szteiter for inviting me to informally continue my
education less than a month later. It is a tribute to them that I would
then take four consecutive CEs without stopping. They can best share how
to run a CE, but as a "student," it is how to creatively take a CE that
I'd like to share.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="june-2013-ce:-scaffolding-creative-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>June 2013 CE: Scaffolding Creative Learning</span></span></h4><section><p><span>I was grateful participants took the time to post links and ideas to
support my inquiries, yet something else intrigued me about the
potential of Collaborative Exploration. Luanne Witkowski, an artist and
one of the CCT instructors, took our ideas and made a diagram
incorporating our scaffolding concepts together; she changed her own
original drawing to include all of ours. I wanted to pay forward and
back my learning too, so I combined the ideas of all the participants,
adapted and taught a lesson outside the CE and then shared the results.
From this jumping into someone else's scaffolding, I went into even more
experimental learning in the next CE.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="july-2013-ce:-design-in-critical-thinking"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>July 2013 CE: Design in Critical Thinking</span></span></h4><section><p><span>In a second CE, I took the title literally and developed a design IN
critical thinking. To try out my triangle tangent thinking model, during
a lesson on leadership in church, I suddenly stopped teaching a
classroom of older professional adults halfway in and asked them to
participate in "design as you go" curriculum---by taking over the class.
Since I wanted to be fair, along with my lesson outline I had already
given them a supposed "icebreaker" activity that they could teach from,
although they also had the option of my continued teaching. Results? My
triangle drawing works as a lesson plan; the class took the tangent, but
surprisingly, I wasn't just relegated to moderator, it became a true
co-facilitation,a model of change at the midpoint for both the
individual and community in the choices and direction.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="september-2013-ce:-everyone-can-think-creatively"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>September 2013 CE: Everyone Can Think Creatively</span></span></h4><section><p><span>This CE had to be commended for its participants humoring my project and
allowing the exploration of testing a CE itself. Was it possible to be a
Creative Failure in a Creativity CE? To evaluate "Creative Failure in a
Creativity CE," I used a simple test. If creative success (unknowingly
given by my CE community) was a product both "novel AND useful," any
post without a comment was a failure ("not useful") to my readers. Any
post that a reader commented on that was similar to something else
already done was "useful," but not novel. Failure had me posting again.
Did I mention what nice people these were when they didn't know what I
was doing? It would have been easy for them to ignore my continued
posting, yet the community of a CE cannot be praised enough. They were
supportive of me and finding academic colleagues who have a sense of
humor is mercifully not novel, but extremely useful in this experience.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="october-2013-ce:-stories-to-scaffold-creative-learning"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>October 2013 CE: Stories to Scaffold Creative Learning</span></span></h4><section><p><span>In this CE I gave myself the challenge of indirect teaching. Could I be
a story "shower", not teller? I took concepts important to me about
teaching with story, yet also tried to leave space for others'
interpretations. Ironically, in some ways creative failure
continued---again I was not as helpful as I had wished. This CE also had
a twist---no hero stories allowed, so my creative and personal stories
had to be ambiguous or use other connecting structures based on the
participants' preferences. It was interesting which stories worked
best---fiction worked more with humor, real experience worked if I
shared about someone other than myself and other kinds worked with
visuals. Collaborative Explorations provide a safe space for joint
learning and teaching to occur. The resulting diversity blends well into
a community that is curious, courageous and creative. Although I have an
M.A. as the first completely online CCT student, the deeply connected CE
community had face-to-face learning "feel." It does require time,
openness, and commitment during times of collective intense focus on a
topic. Yet, seeing where the participant-directed 'design as you go'
curriculum ends up is worth investing in and sharing with others. After
all, there are many other ways still out there to try out CEs.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-4"><h4 class="firn-headline firn-headline-4" id="postscript"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Postscript</span></span></h4><section><p><span>I also ran a CE for the Susquehanna Conference of the UMC for 10 days,
