Pattern Audit Routine 
=====================

### Context 

As a collection of patterns grows, some of them may lose relevance.

### Problem 

Not all of the patterns are equally relevant and some will become
completely irrelevant as a project evolves.

### Solution 

It is important to “tune” and “prune” the collection of patterns. Bring
a real-time aspect to debugging individual patterns using the following
five-part “[Paragogical Action
Review](http://metameso.org/~joe/docs/The-Paragogical-Action-Review.pdf)”
@peeragogy-handbook [Chapter 28]: (1) Review what was supposed to
happen. (2) Establish what is happening/happened. (3) Determine what’s
right and wrong with what we are doing/have done. (4) What did we learn
or change? (5) What else should we change going forward?

After asking these five questions with respect to progress made with any
pattern, the pattern will likely become clearer and/or show its
irrelevance. Periodically run a full audit of the pattern catalog. After
a thorough review, any patterns that cannot be revised to become
relevant for our current interests can be moved to the
<span>**Scrapbook**</span>.

### Rationale 

We want to keep the attention focused on the most relevant issues.

### Resolution 

This pattern reminds us to improve our patterns, and presents a method
for refocusing.

### What’s Next 

Regularly go through the <span>**Pattern Audit Routine**</span> in our
future meetings.
