learning to themselves, yet they also generously share resources with
one another. It is this latter trait that is becoming increasingly
important as the role of the educator continues to expand. As
educational technology research specialist Stephen Downes</span><a class="firn-external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-downes/the-role-of-the-educator_b_790937.html" target="_blank">observes</a><span>,
the expectations on teachers have grown from "being expert in the
discipline of teaching and pedagogy...[to needing to have] up-to-date
and relevant knowledge and experience in it. Even a teacher of basic
disciplines such as science, history or mathematics must remain
grounded, as no discipline has remained stable for very long, and all
disciplines require a deeper insight in order to be taught effectively."
It is no longer possible for an educator to work alone to fulfil each of
these roles: the solution is to work and learn in collaboration with
others. This is where peer-based sharing and learning online,
connected/networked learning, or peeragogy, can play an important role
in helping educators.</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="becoming-a-connectednetworked-learner"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Becoming a connected/networked learner</span></span></h1><section><p><span>The following steps are set out in 'phases' in order to suggest possible
