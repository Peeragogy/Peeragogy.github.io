A specific project 
==================

### Context 

You find yourself interested in or concerned about something, but you
only have a vague idea about how it works or how you fit in.

### Problem 

It’s easy to think about issues that matter: there are many of them. The
problem is figuring out what you’re going to do about it. As a further
problem, getting concrete can be scary, because you risk failure.[^1]

### Solution 

If you *are* able to get concrete about something to do, learn, and
achieve, you move from thinking about a topic to becoming a
practitioner. You may realize that your “specific project” is too large
to tackle directly. In this case, you will have to become even more
specific. Maintaining a project <span>**Roadmap**</span> can help keep
track of the smaller pieces and the bigger picture.

### Rationale 

Being specific is important for bringing about change.[^2] But while
actions speak louder than words, it’s important to act in a coherent way
if you want to be understood by others. However, in general it would be
a mistake to try to seek consensus before acting: it’s much better to
combine action with dialog.

### What’s Next 

Each project connected with the Peeragogy Project should be described
with one or more patterns, each with specific, tangible “what’s next”
steps.[^3] The <span>**Pattern Audit Routine**</span> can help make
these “what’s next” steps concrete.

[^1]: In the Peeragogy project and more broadly, we’ve observed that
    some people are happy with a sense of experience or process, while
    others want to see results. Some others are in the middle. All of
    these variations are OK! However, we are often blinded by our own
    preferences, and in the worst case this can undermine or destroy
    group dynamics. At the very least it will add tension, as some want
    to continue to discuss and engage generally while others want to
    move forward. When the forward-movers try to act, those enjoying the
    experience may attempt to shut them down or may feel that they are
    being left out/behind.

[^2]: In the January, 2013, plenary session, [Independent Publishers of
    New England](http://ipne.org) (IPNE) President Tordis Isselhardt
    quietly listened to a presentation about how we created the
    *Peeragogy Handbook*. During the Q&A, she spoke up, wondering if
    peer-learning effort in IPNE might be more likely to succeed if the
    organization’s members “focused around a specific project.” As this
    lightbulb illuminated the room, those of us attending the plenary
    session suggested that IPNE could focus the project by creating an
    “Independent Publishing Handbook.” (Applause!) In the course of
    creating the IPNE Handbook, peer learners would assemble resource
    repositories, exchange expertise, and collaboratively edit
    documents. To provide motivation and incentive to participate in
    “PeerPubU”, members of the association will earn authorship credit
    for contributing articles, editor credit for working on the
    manuscript, and can spin off their own chapters as stand-alone,
    profit-making publications.

[^3]: We’ve found that writing papers for conferences is one activity
    that can help us focus and make improvements to our body of work
    that would not come about by simply meandering through revisions to
    the *Peeragogy Handbook*. Remixing these efforts into the handbook
    is a good source of improvements; see <span>**Use or Make**</span>.
