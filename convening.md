Group identity
--------------

Note that there are many groups that may not need to be “convened”,
since they already exist. There is a good story from [A. T.
Ariyaratne](http://www.sarvodayausa.org/learn/a-t-ariyartne/) in his
[collected
works](http://www.sarvodaya.org/about/philosophy/collected-works-vol-1/rural-self-help)
in which he does “convene” a natural group (a village) - but in any
case, keep in mind at the outset that the degree of group-consciousness
that is necessary for peer learning to take place is not fixed. In this
section, we suppose you are just at the point of kicking off a project.
What steps should you take? We suggest you take a moment to ponder the
following questions first - and revisit them afterward, as a way to
identify best practices for the next effort.

There will be a quiz
--------------------

Those taking the initiative should ask themselves the traditional Who,
What, Where, When, Why, and How. ([Simon
Sinek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sinek) suggests to begin with
Why, and we touched on Who, above!). In doing so, preliminary
assumptions for design and structure are established. However, in peer
learning it is particularly important to maintain a healthy degree of
openness, so that future group members can also form their answers on
those questions. In particular, this suggests that the design and
structure of the project (and the group) may change over time. Here, we
riff on the traditional 5W’s+H with six clusters of questions to help
you focus your thinking about the project and amplify its positive
outcomes.

Expectations for participants
-----------------------------

**1. Who: Roles and flux**

-   What are some of the roles that people are likely to fall into (e.g.
    Newcomer, Wrapper, Lurker, Aggregator, etc.)?
-   How likely is it that participants will stick with the project? If
    you expect many participants to leave, how will this effect the
    group and the outcome?
-   Do you envision new people joining the group as time goes by? If so,
    what features are you designing that will support their integration
    into an existing flow?
-   Will the project work if people dip in and out? If so, what features
    support that? If not, how will people stay focused?

**2. What: Nature of the project**

-   What skills are required? What skills are you trying to build?
-   What kinds of change will participants undergo? Will they be heading
    into new ground? Changing their minds about something? Learning
    about learning?
-   What social objective, or “product” if any, is the project aiming to
    achieve?
-   What’s the ‘hook?’ Unless you are working with an existing group, or
    re-using an existing modality, consistent participation may not be a
    given.

**3. When: Time management**

-   What do you expect the group to do, from the moment it convenes, to
    the end of its life-span, to create the specific outcome that will
    exist at the conclusion of its last meeting? [2] Note that what
    people ACTUALLY do may be different from what you envision at the
    outset, so you may want to revisit this question (and your answer)
    again as the project progresses.
-   Keeping in mind that at least one period of is inertia is very
    likely [2], what event(s) do you anticipate happening in the group
    that will bring things back together, set a new direction, or
    generally get things on track? More generally, what kinds of
    contingencies does your group face? How does it interface to the
    “outside world”?
-   What pre-existing narratives or workflows could you copy in your
    group?
-   How much of a time commitment do you expect from participants? Is
    this kind of commitment realistic for members of your group?
-   What, if anything, can you do to make participation “easy” in the
    sense that it happens in the natural flow of life for group members?
-   Does everyone need to participate equally? How might non-equal
    participation play out for participants down the line?

**4. Where: Journey vs Destination**

-   What structures will support participants in their journey to the
    end result(s) you (or they) have envisioned? What content can you
    use to flesh out this structure?
-   Where can the structure “flex” to accommodate unknown developments
    or needs as participants learn, discover, and progress?

**5. Why: Tool/platform choice**

-   What tools are particularly suited to this group? Consider such
    features as learning styles and experiences, geographical diversity,
    the need for centralization (or de-centralization), cultural
    expectations related to group work, sharing, and emerging
    leadership.
-   Is there an inherent draw to this project for a given population, or
    are you as facilitator going to have to work at keeping people
    involved? How might your answer influence your choice of tools? Is
    the reward for completion the learning itself, or something more
    tangible?
-   In choosing tools, how do you prioritize such values and objectives
    as easy entry, diverse uses, and high ceilings for sophisticated
    expansion?

**6. How: Linearity vs Messiness**

-   How will your group manage feedback in a constructive way?
-   Why might participants feel motivated to give feedback?
-   How firm and extensive are the social contracts for this group? Do
    they apply to everyone equally, or do they vary with participation
    level?
-   What do people need to know at the start? What can you work out as
    you go along? Who decides?
-   How welcome are “meta-discussions”? What kinds of discussions are
    not likely to be welcome? Do you have facilities in place for
    “breakout groups” or other peer-to-peer interactions?
    (Alternatively, if the project is mostly distributed, do you have
    any facilities in place for coming together as a group?)

Cycles of group development
---------------------------

The above questions remain important thoughout the life of the project.
People may come and go, particpants may propose fundamentally new
approaches, people may evolve from lurkers to major content creators or
vice-versa. The questions we suggest can be most effective if your group
discusses them over time, as part of its workflow, using synchronous
online meetings (e.g., [Big Blue Button](http://www.bigbluebutton.org/),
[Adobe
Connect](http://success.adobe.com/en/na/sem/products/connect/1109_6011_connect_webinars.html?sdid=IEASO&skwcid=TC\textbar{}22191\textbar{}adobe%20connect\textbar{}\textbar{}S\textbar{}e\textbar{}5894715262),
[Blackboard
Collaborate](http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx)),
forums, Google docs, wikis, and/or email lists. Regular meetings are one
way to establish a “heartbeat” for the group.

In thinking about other ways of structuring things, note that the “body”
of the *Peeragogy Handbook* follows a [Tuckman-like
outline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forming-storming-norming-performing)
(*Convening a Group* is our “forming”, *Organizing a Learning Context*
is our “storming and norming”, *Co-working/Facilitation* is our
“performing”, and *Assessment* is our “adjourning”). But we agree with
Gersick <span>[</span>1<span>]</span>, and Engeström
<span>[</span>2<span>]</span>, that groups do not always follow a linear
or cyclical pattern with their activities!

Nevertheless, there may be some specific stages or phases that you want
*your* group to go through. Do you need some “milestones,” for example?
How will you know when you’ve achieved “success?”

In closing, it is worth reminding you that it is natural for groups to
experience conflict, especially as they grow or cross other threshold
points or milestones - or perhaps more likely, when they don’t cross
important milestones in a timely fashion (ah, so you remember those
milestones from the previous section!). Nevertheless, there are some
strategies can be used to make this conflict productive, rather than
merely destructive (see Ozturk and Simsek
<span>[</span>3<span>]</span>).
