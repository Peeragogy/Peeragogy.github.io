*Peeragogy* is a flexible framework of techniques for peer learning and
peer knowledge production. As pedagogy theoretically articulates the
transmission of knowledge from teachers to students, peeragogy describes
the way peers produce and utilize knowledge together. With OER, wikis,
the internet, Free Software and mobile networks, groups of people can
learn, connect and create knowledge together inside and outside of
formal institutions in ways never before possible. These tools can
facilitate connected learning, and collaborative engagement but they
only work well when combined with practices that work well for the
people involved.

Peeragogy makes use of a novel re-interpretation of four of Wikipedia’s
five pillars: *neutral POV*; *free content*; *respect and civility*; and
*no firm rules* – extending them beyond encyclopedia style creation (see
page for a summary). The learning mind-set and new strategies for good
faith collaboration that we are uncovering in the Peeragogy project can
be applied in classrooms, hackerspaces, business meetings, wiki projects
and interconnected collaborations across an entire society.

In this book we will examine the way the values that helped shape
Wikipedia and free software can be applied in other learning contexts.
We draw on our experience as practitioners of “Mode 2” knowledge
production (i.e. in *loosely knit multidisciplinary teams working
together for short periods of time on specific real-world problems*) –
both as co-authors of this book and in a wide variety of other projects.
As you read, you are invited to look for further applications of
peeragogy in your life and in the world around you. We begin with a
quick walkthrough of the Peeragogy concept, some warm-up exercises, and
a Peeragogy project directory that we think will be helpful as you get
started:
