They
often don't know where to start. They may have a bunch of ideas that the
old-timers have never considered -- or they may think they have new
ideas, which are actually a different take on an old idea; see </span><a class="firn-internal" href="/reduce_reuse_recycle">Reduce, reuse, recycle</a><span>.
People who are new to the project can tell you what
makes their participation difficult. Since you're learning as you go as
well, you can ask yourself the same question: what aspects of this
encounter are difficult for me?</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="solution"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Solution</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Instead of thinking of newcomers as "them", and trying to provide
solutions, we focus on newcomers as "us" -- which makes the search for
solutions that much more urgent. We permit ourselves to ask naive
questions. We entertain vague ideas. We add concreteness by trying A
specific project. We may then genuinely turn to others for help. We aim
to foster a culture in which the focus for everyone is on addressing our
own learning challenges rather than on "providing" solutions for others
[1]. When you begin a new project, try to systematically take notes and
gather data to analyze and reflect upon later; leave artifacts for other
future newcomers to use and build upon in their own research. In
practice this may be a lot to ask for someone just joining a group, but
over time we may have many ways to structure our collective engagement
so that it leads to research cycles based on the "action research" steps</span><em><span>reflect</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>plan</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>act</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>observe</span></em><span>. Note that there is a parallel
with the four facets </span><em><span>assess</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>convene</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>organize</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>cooperate</span></em><span> from
Figure [fig:connections]. The history of the action research approach,
with particular emphasis on educational applications, is surveyed in
[5]. One method for doing the reflection/assessment step is presented in
the </span><a class="firn-internal" href="/scrapbook">Scrapbook</a><span> pattern. Be flexible: networked attention (even more so
than rigid cycles [3]) leads to new ways of knowing and expanded access
to knowledge-production [7,8].</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="rationale"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Rationale</span></span></h1><section><p><span>A newcomer's confusion about how best to get involved or what the point

useful to </span><em><span>us</span></em><span>. By welcoming newcomers, we enhance the sense of</span><strong><span>mutuality</span></strong><span> with people who have never encountered the project before,
and learn together with them. The facts start to become useful when we

However, "Nearly all editors begin with a burst of activity, then
quickly tail off" [6]. The degree to which those editors who are
retained strive to maintain a "beginner's mind" is less clear. As
regards learning their way around the community, there is quantitative
support [6] for the claim that "novice users learn the rules and
conventions for contributing both through observation and direct
coaching from more knowledgeable others" [2].</span></p><p><img src="/images/The_Science_Laboratory.jpg" /><span>\\</span><em><span>Science Hall: Aspatria Agricultural College, Aspatria, Cumberland, UK</span></em></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="example-2"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Example 2</span></span></h1><section><p><span>It will often be pragmatic to connect Newcomers with employment
